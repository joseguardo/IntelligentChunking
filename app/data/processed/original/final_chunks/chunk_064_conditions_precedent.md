# 30.3 Resignation of a Borrower

(a) In this clause 30.3, clause 30.5 (Resignation of a Guarantor) and clause 30.7 (Resignation and Release of Security on Disposal), "Third Party Disposal" means the disposal of an Obligor to a person which is not a Group Company where that disposal is permitted under clause 26.16 (Disposals) or made with the approval of the Majority Lenders (and the Parent has confirmed this is the case).

(b) If a Borrower is the subject of a Third Party Disposal, the Parent may request that such Borrower (other than the Parent) ceases to be a Borrower by delivering to the Facility Agent a Resignation Letter.

(c) The Facility Agent shall accept a Resignation Letter and notify the Parent and the other Senior Finance Parties of its acceptance if:

1. (i) the Parent has confirmed that no Default is continuing or would result from the acceptance of the Resignation Letter;
2. (ii) the Borrower is under no actual or contingent obligations as a Borrower under any Senior Finance Document;
3. (iii) where the Borrower is also a Guarantor (unless its resignation has been accepted in accordance with clause 30.5 (Resignation of a Guarantor)), its obligations in its capacity as Guarantor continue to be legal, valid, binding and enforceable and in full force and effect (subject to the Legal Reservations) and the amount guaranteed by it as a Guarantor is not decreased (and the Parent has confirmed this is the case); and
4. (iv) the Parent has confirmed that it shall ensure that any relevant Disposal Proceeds will be applied in accordance with clause 11.3 (Application of Mandatory Prepayments and Cancellations).

(d) Upon notification by the Facility Agent to the Parent of its acceptance of the resignation of a Borrower, that company shall cease to be a Borrower and shall have no further rights or obligations under the Senior Finance Documents as a Borrower except that the resignation shall not take effect (and the Borrower will continue to have rights and obligations under the Senior Finance Documents) until the date on which the Third Party Disposal takes effect.

(e) The Facility Agent may, at the cost and expense of the Parent, require a legal opinion from counsel to the Facility Agent confirming the matters set out in paragraph (c)(iii) above and the Facility Agent shall be under no obligation to accept a Resignation Letter until it has obtained such opinion in form and substance satisfactory to it.

# 30.4 Additional Guarantors
