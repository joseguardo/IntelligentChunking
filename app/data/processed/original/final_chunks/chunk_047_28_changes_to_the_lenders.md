(a) Subject to the conditions set out in clause 28.2 (Conditions of Assignment, Transfer or Sub-Participation) an assignment may be effected in accordance with paragraph (c) below when the Facility Agent executes an Assignment Agreement delivered to it and executed by the Existing Lender and the New Lender. The Facility Agent shall, subject to paragraph (b) below, as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt by it of a duly completed Assignment Agreement appearing on its face to comply with the terms of this agreement and delivered in accordance with the terms of this agreement, execute that Assignment Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, an Assignment Agreement will be treated as duly completed notwithstanding that the Parent may not have executed that Assignment Agreement to formally acknowledge the transfer of obligations.

(b) The Facility Agent shall only be obliged to execute an Assignment Agreement delivered to it by the Existing Lender and the New Lender once it is satisfied it has complied with all necessary "know your customer" or other similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations in relation to the assignment to such New Lender.

(c) Subject to clause 28.12 (Pro Rata Interest Settlement), on the Transfer Date:

1. the Existing Lender will assign absolutely to the New Lender its rights under the Senior Finance Documents and in respect of the Transaction Security expressed to be the subject of the assignment in the Assignment Agreement;
2. the Existing Lender will be released from the obligations (the "Relevant Obligations") expressed to be the subject of the release in the Assignment Agreement (and any corresponding obligations by which it is bound in respect of the Transaction Security); and
3. the New Lender shall become a Party as a "Lender" and will be bound by obligations equivalent to the Relevant Obligations.

(d) Lenders may utilise procedures other than those set out in this clause 28.6 to assign their rights under the Senior Finance Documents provided that they comply with the conditions set out in clause 28.2 (Conditions of Assignment, Transfer or Sub-Participation).

# 28.7 Copy of Transfer Certificate, Assignment Agreement or Increase Confirmation to Parent

The Facility Agent shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after it has executed a Transfer Certificate, an Assignment Agreement or an Increase Confirmation, send to the Parent a copy of that Transfer Certificate, Assignment Agreement or Increase Confirmation.

# 28.8 New CAR Facility Lender

1. Each CAR Facility Lender shall, by countersigning a CAR Facility Establishment Notice and delivering it to the Facility Agent be, deemed to be a party to this agreement as a Lender from the CAR Facility Date and:
1. each of the Obligors will owe obligations to the CAR Facility Lender in accordance with the terms of the Senior Finance Documents;
2. subject to any limits recorded in the Senior Finance Documents, the guarantees and security recorded in the Senior Finance Documents in favour of the Senior Finance Parties will extend to the CAR Facility Lender and the CAR Facility Loans; and
3. the Senior Finance Parties in each of their respective capacities shall acquire the rights and assume the obligations between themselves as if the CAR Facility Lender had been an original lender under this agreement in that capacity.

# 28.9 Accession of Hedge Counterparties

1. Any person which becomes a party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Hedge Counterparty shall at the same time, become a Party to this agreement as a Hedge Counterparty in accordance with clause 20.10 (Creditor Accession Undertaking) of the Intercreditor Agreement.
2. Where this agreement or any other Senior Finance Document imposes an obligation on a Hedge Counterparty and the relevant Hedge Counterparty is an Affiliate of a Lender and is not a party to that document, the relevant Lender shall ensure that the obligation is performed by its Affiliate.

# 28.10 Security over Lenders' Rights

In addition to the other rights provided to Lenders under this clause 28 (Changes to the Lenders), each Lender may without consulting with or obtaining consent from any Obligor, at any time charge, assign or otherwise create Security in or over (whether by way of collateral or otherwise) all or any of its rights under any Senior Finance Document to secure obligations of that Lender including, without limitation:

- (a) any charge, assignment or other Security to secure obligations to a federal reserve or central bank; and
- (b) in the case of any Lender which is a fund, any charge, assignment or other Security granted to any holders (or trustee or representatives of holders) of obligations owed, or securities issued, by that Lender as security for those obligations or securities,

except that no such charge, assignment or Security shall:

- (i) release a Lender from any of its obligations under the Senior Finance Documents or substitute the beneficiary of the relevant charge, assignment or Security for the Lender as a party to any of the Senior Finance Documents; or
- (ii) require any payments to be made by an Obligor or grant to any person any more extensive rights than those required to be made or granted to the relevant Lender under the Senior Finance Documents.

# 28.11 Continuation of Security

(a) Each Obligor consents to the assignments and transfers of rights and obligations permitted under and made in accordance with this clause 28 (Changes to the Lenders). Each Obligor agrees and confirms that its guarantee and indemnity obligations under the Senior Finance Documents and any Transaction Security granted by it in support of its own borrowing obligations or its guarantee or indemnity obligations under the Senior Finance Documents will continue notwithstanding any assignment or transfer under this clause 28 (Changes to the Lenders) and will extend to cover and support obligations owed to New Lenders and to continuing Senior Finance Parties.

(b) The Parent (for itself and as agent for the Obligors) will (at its own cost) as soon as reasonably practicable execute such documents and take such other actions as are necessary to effect or perfect an assignment or a transfer of rights and/or obligations to a New Lender under the Senior Finance Documents. Such action will include:

- (i) promptly countersigning Assignment Agreements (although any delay or failure by the Parent to so countersign an Assignment Agreement will not invalidate its operation); and
- (ii) subject to the Agreed Security Principles taking such steps as the Facility Agent or the Security Agent may request (including re-execution of Transaction Security Documents) for the purpose of ensuring that the New Lender has (and the other Senior Finance Parties continue to have) the benefit of the same security interests under the Transaction Security Documents as existed immediately before the relevant transfer.

# 28.12 Pro Rata Interest Settlement

If the Facility Agent has notified the Lenders that it is able to distribute interest payments on a "pro rata basis" to Existing Lenders and New Lenders then (in respect of any transfer pursuant to clause 28.5 (Procedure for Transfer) or any assignment pursuant to clause 28.6 (Procedure for Assignment or Assignment and Assumption) the Transfer Date of which, in each case, is after the date of such notification and is not on the last day of an Interest Period):

1. any interest or fees in respect of the relevant participation which are expressed to accrue by reference to the lapse of time shall continue to accrue in favour of the Existing Lender up to but excluding the Transfer Date ("Accrued Amounts") and shall become due and payable to the Existing Lender (without further interest accruing on them) on the last day of the current Interest Period (or, if the Interest Period is longer than six Months, on the next of the dates which falls at six-Monthly intervals after the first day of that Interest Period); and
2. the rights assigned or transferred by the Existing Lender will not include the right to the Accrued Amounts so that, for the avoidance of doubt:

1. when the Accrued Amounts become payable, those Accrued Amounts will be payable for the account of the Existing Lender; and
2. the amount payable to the New Lender on that date will be the amount which would, but for the application of this clause 28.12, have been payable to it on that date, but after deduction of the Accrued Amounts.
3. In this clause 28.12 references to "Interest Period" shall be construed to include a reference to any other period for accrual of fees.
