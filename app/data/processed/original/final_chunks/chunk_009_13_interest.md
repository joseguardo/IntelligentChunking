13. INTEREST

# 13.1 Calculation of Interest

The rate of interest on each Loan for each Interest Period is the percentage rate per annum which is the aggregate of the applicable:

- (a) Margin; and
- (b) LIBOR or, in relation to any Loan in euro, EURIBOR.

# 13.2 Payment of Interest

- (a) The Borrower to which a Loan has been made shall pay accrued interest on that Loan on the last day of each Interest Period (and, if the Interest Period is longer than six Months, on the dates falling at three Monthly intervals after the first day of the Interest Period).
- (b) If the Compliance Certificate received by the Facility Agent which relates to the relevant Annual Financial Statements shows that:
- (i) a higher Margin should have applied during a certain period, then the Parent shall (or shall ensure the relevant Borrower shall) within 3 Business Days of demand pay to the Facility Agent any amounts necessary to put the Facility Agent and the Lenders in the position they would have been in had the appropriate rate of the Margin applied during such period; and
- (ii) a lower rate of Margin should have applied during a certain period, then the next four interest payments to the Lenders under this agreement shall be reduced rateably to put the Group in the position it would have been in had the appropriate rate of the Margin applied during the relevant Interest Period, provided that payments to a Lender will only be reduced to the extent it was a Lender during that Interest Period when a lower Margin should have applied.

# 13.3 Default Interest

(a) If an Obligor fails to pay any amount payable by it under a Senior Finance Document on its due date, interest shall accrue on the overdue amount from the due date up to the date of actual payment (both before and after judgment) at a rate which, subject to paragraph (b) below, is 1 per cent per annum higher than the rate which would have been payable if the overdue amount had, during the period of non-payment, constituted a Loan in the currency of the overdue amount and made under the Facility to which the overdue amount is, in the reasonable opinion of the Facility Agent, referable (or if there is no referable Facility, under Facility A) for successive Interest Periods, each of a duration selected by the Facility Agent (acting reasonably). Any interest accruing under this clause 13.3 shall be immediately payable by the Obligor on demand by the Facility Agent.

(b) If any overdue amount consists of all or part of a Loan which became due on a day which was not the last day of an Interest Period relating to that Loan:

- (i) the first Interest Period for that overdue amount shall have a duration equal to the unexpired portion of the current Interest Period relating to that Loan; and
- (ii) the rate of interest applying to the overdue amount during that first Interest Period shall be 1 per cent per annum higher than the rate which would have applied if the overdue amount had not become due.

(c) Default interest (if unpaid) arising on an overdue amount will be compounded with the overdue amount at the end of each Interest Period applicable to that overdue amount but will remain immediately due and payable.

# 13.4 Notification of Rates of Interest

The Facility Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders and the relevant Borrower (or the Parent) of the determination of a rate of interest under this agreement.
