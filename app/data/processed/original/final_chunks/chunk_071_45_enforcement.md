45. ENFORCEMENT

# 45.1 Jurisdiction of English Courts

(a) The courts of England have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute arising out of or in connection with this agreement (including a dispute relating to the existence, validity or termination of this agreement or any non-contractual obligation arising out of or in connection with this agreement) (a "Dispute").

(b) The Parties agree that the courts of England are the most appropriate and convenient courts to settle Disputes and accordingly no Party will argue to the contrary.

# 45.2 Service of Process

(a) Without prejudice to any other mode of service allowed under any relevant law, each Obligor (other than an Obligor incorporated in England and Wales):

(i) irrevocably appoints the Parent as its agent for service of process in relation to any proceedings before the English courts in connection with any Senior Finance Document (and the Parent by its execution of this agreement, accepts that appointment); and

(ii) agrees that failure by an agent for service of process to notify the relevant Obligor of the process will not invalidate the proceedings concerned.

(b) If any person appointed as an agent for service of process is unable for any reason to act as agent for service of process, the Parent (on behalf of all the Obligors) must immediately (and in any event within five days of such event taking place) appoint another agent on terms acceptable to the Facility Agent. Failing this, the Facility Agent may appoint another agent for this purpose.

(c) The Parent expressly agrees and consents to the provisions of this clause 45 (Enforcement) and clause 44 (Governing Law).

This agreement has been entered into on the date stated at the beginning of this agreement.
