# 14. SHARES

(a) Transaction Security will be granted over the shares in Material Companies (other than the Parent).

(b) The relevant Transaction Security Document will be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction of Incorporation of the Group member whose shares are subject to the Security and not by the law of the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Group member granting the Security.

(d) Where customary the share certificate (or other documents evidencing title to the relevant shares) and a stock transfer form executed in blank (or local law equivalent) will be provided to the Security Agent and where required by law the share certificate or shareholders register will be endorsed or written up and the endorsed share certificate or a copy of the written up register provided to the Security Agent.

(e) Unless the restriction is required by law, the constitutional documents of the Group member whose shares are to be pledged will be amended to remove any restriction on grant of security or any provision which restricts enforcement of the transaction Security, the transfer or the registration of the transfer of the shares on enforcement of the Security granted over them.

# 15. REAL ESTATE

(a) Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, security shall be granted over freehold and leasehold property which has a higher of the market value or book value (or premium value, in the case of leasehold) in excess of £2,000,000.

(b) There will be no obligation to investigate title, provide surveys or other insurance or environmental due diligence.

(c) A Group Company providing security over material real estate will be under an obligation to use reasonable endeavours to obtain any landlord consent required to grant any Security over its material real estate required pursuant to these security principles.

# 16. RELEASE OF SECURITY

Unless required by local law, the circumstances in which the Security shall be released should not be dealt with in Individual Security Documents but, if so required, shall, except to the extent required by local law, be the same as those set out in the Intercreditor Agreement.
