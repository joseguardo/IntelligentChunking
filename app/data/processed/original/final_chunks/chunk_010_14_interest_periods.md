14. INTEREST PERIODS

# 14.1 Selection of Interest Periods and Terms

(a) A Borrower (or the Parent on behalf of a Borrower) may select an Interest Period for a Loan in the Utilisation Request for that Loan or (if the Loan is a Term Loan and has already been borrowed) in a Selection Notice.

(b) Each Selection Notice for a Term Loan is irrevocable and must be delivered to the Facility Agent by the Borrower (or the Parent on behalf of the Borrower) to which that Term Loan was made not later than the Specified Time.

(c) If a Borrower (or the Parent) fails to deliver a Selection Notice to the Facility Agent in accordance with paragraph (b) above, the relevant Interest Period will be three Months.

(d) Subject to this clause 14, a Borrower (or the Parent) may select an Interest Period of one, two, three or six Months for a Term Loan or one, two, three or six Months for a Revolving Facility Loan or any other period agreed between the Parent and the Facility Agent (acting on the instructions of all the Lenders in relation to the relevant Loan).

(e) An Interest Period for a Loan shall not extend beyond the Termination Date applicable to its Facility.

(f) Each Interest Period for a Term Loan shall start on the Utilisation Date or (if already made) on the last day of its preceding Interest Period.

(g) A Revolving Facility Loan has one Interest Period only.

# 14. Non-Business Days

If an Interest Period would otherwise end on a day which is not a Business Day, that Interest Period will instead end on the next Business Day in that calendar month (if there is one) or the preceding Business Day (if there is not).
