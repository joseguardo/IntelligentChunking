CAR Facility Establishment Notice or Increase Confirmation shall not be invalidated by any failure of a Lender to comply with this clause 17.5.

# 17.6 Stamp Taxes

The Parent shall pay and, within three Business Days of demand, indemnify each Senior Finance Party and Arranger against any cost, loss or liability that Senior Finance Party or Arranger incurs in relation to all stamp duty, registration and other similar Taxes payable in respect of any Senior Finance Document.

# 17.7 VAT

(a) All amounts expressed to be payable under a Senior Finance Document by any Party to a Senior Finance Party which (in whole or in part) constitute the consideration for any supply for VAT purposes are deemed to be exclusive of any VAT which is chargeable on that supply, and accordingly, subject to paragraph (b) below, if VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Senior Finance Party to any Party under a Senior Finance Document and such Senior Finance Party is required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT, that Party must pay to such Senior Finance Party (in addition to and at the same time as paying any other consideration for such supply) an amount equal to the amount of the VAT (and such Senior Finance Party must promptly provide an appropriate VAT invoice to that Party).

(b) If VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Senior Finance Party (the "Supplier") to any other Senior Finance Party (the "Recipient") under a Senior Finance Document, and any Party other than the Recipient (the "Relevant Party") is required by the terms of any Senior Finance Document to pay an amount equal to the consideration for that supply to the Supplier (rather than being required to reimburse or indemnify the Recipient in respect of that consideration):

(i) (where the Supplier is the person required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT) the Relevant Party must also pay to the Supplier (at the same time as paying that amount) an additional amount equal to the amount of the VAT. The Recipient must (where this paragraph (i) applies) promptly pay to the Relevant Party an amount equal to any credit or repayment the Recipient receives from the relevant tax authority which the Recipient reasonably determines relates to the VAT chargeable on that supply; and

(ii) (where the Recipient is the person required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT) the Relevant Party must promptly, following demand from the Recipient, pay to the Recipient an amount equal to the VAT chargeable on that supply but only to the extent that the Recipient reasonably determines that it is not entitled to credit or repayment from the relevant tax authority in respect of that VAT.

(c) Where a Senior Finance Document requires any Party to reimburse or indemnify a Senior Finance Party for any cost or expense, that Party shall reimburse or indemnify (as the case may be) such Senior Finance Party for the full amount of such cost or expense, including such part thereof as represents VAT, save to the extent that such Senior Finance Party reasonably determines that it is entitled to credit or repayment in respect of such VAT from the relevant tax authority.

(d) Any reference in this clause 17.7 to any Party shall, at any time when such Party is treated as a member of a group for VAT purposes, include (where appropriate and unless the context otherwise requires) a reference to the representative member of such group at such time (the term "representative member" to have the same meaning as in the Value Added Tax Act 1994 or in any equivalent legislation of another jurisdiction).

# 17.8 FATCA Information

(a) Subject to paragraph (c) below, each Party shall, within ten Business Days of a reasonable request by another Party:

- (i) confirm to that other Party whether it is:
- - (A) a FATCA Exempt Party; or
- (B) not a FATCA Exempt Party; and

(ii) supply to that other Party such forms, documentation and other Information relating to its status under FATCA as that other Party reasonably requests for the purposes of that other Party's compliance with FATCA;
- (iii) supply to that other Party such forms, documentation and other information relating to its status as that other Party reasonably requests for the purposes of that other Party's compliance with any other law, regulation, or exchange of information regime.

(b) If a Party confirms to another Party pursuant to paragraph (a)(i) above that it is a FATCA Exempt Party and it subsequently becomes aware that it is not, or has ceased to be a FATCA Exempt Party, that Party shall notify that other Party reasonably promptly.

(c) Paragraph (a) above shall not oblige any Senior Finance Party to do anything, and paragraph (a)(iii) above shall not oblige any other Party to do anything, which would or might in its reasonable opinion constitute a breach of:

- (i) any law or regulation;
- (ii) any fiduciary duty; or
- (iii) any duty of confidentiality.

(d) If a Party fails to confirm whether or not it is a FATCA Exempt Party or to supply forms, documentation or other information requested in accordance with paragraph (a)(i) or (ii) above (including, for the avoidance of doubt, where clause 17.8(c) above applies), then such Party shall be treated for the purposes of the Senior Finance Documents (and payments under them) as if it is not a FATCA Exempt Party until such time as the Party in question provides the requested confirmation, forms, documentation or other information.

# 17.9 FATCA Deduction

(a) Each Party may make any FATCA Deduction it is required to make by FATCA, and any payment required in connection with that FATCA Deduction, and no Party shall be required to increase any payment in respect of which it makes such a FATCA Deduction or otherwise compensate the recipient of the payment for that FATCA Deduction.

(b) Each Party shall promptly, upon becoming aware that it must make a FATCA Deduction (or that there is any change in the rate or the basis of such FATCA Deduction), notify the Party to whom it is making the payment and, in addition, shall notify the Parent and the Facility Agent and the Facility Agent shall notify the other Senior Finance Parties.
