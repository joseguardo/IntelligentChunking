Agreed Security Principles, the Parent shall ensure that at all times after the Closing Date, the aggregate EBITDA (as defined in clause 25 (Financial Covenants)) of those of the Guarantors with positive EBITDA and the aggregate gross assets of those of the Guarantors with positive net worth (in each case calculated on an unconsolidated basis and excluding all intra-group items and investments in Subsidiaries of any Group Company) represents not less than 85 per cent of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in clause 25 (Financial Covenants)) and consolidated gross assets of the Group (ignoring, for the purposes of consolidation, those Group Companies with zero or negative EBITDA or no net assets).

(b) The Parent need only perform its obligations under paragraph (a) above if it is not unlawful for the relevant person to become a Guarantor and that person becoming a Guarantor would not result in personal liability for that person's directors or other management. Each Obligor must use, and must procure that the relevant person uses, all reasonable endeavours lawfully available to avoid any such unlawfulness or personal liability. This includes agreeing to a limit on the amount guaranteed. The Facility Agent may (but shall not be obliged to) agree to such a limit if, in its opinion, to do so would avoid the relevant unlawfulness or personal liability.
