# 17.2 Tax Gross-up

(a) Each Obligor shall make all payments to be made by it without any Tax Deduction, unless a Tax Deduction is required by law.

(b) The Parent shall promptly upon becoming aware that an Obligor must make a Tax Deduction (or that there is any change in the rate or the basis of a Tax Deduction) notify the Facility Agent accordingly. Similarly a Lender shall notify the Facility Agent on becoming so aware in respect of a payment payable to that Lender. If the Facility Agent receives such notification from a Lender it shall notify the Parent and that Obligor.

(c) If a Tax Deduction is required by law to be made by an Obligor, the amount of the payment due from that Obligor shall be increased to an amount which (after making any Tax Deduction) leaves an amount equal to the payment which would have been due if no Tax Deduction had been required.

(d) A payment shall not be increased under paragraph (c) above by reason of a Tax Deduction on account of Tax imposed by the United Kingdom, if on the date on which the payment falls due:

1. the payment could have been made to the relevant Lender without a Tax Deduction if the Lender had been a Qualifying Lender, but on that date that Lender is not or has ceased to be a Qualifying Lender other than as a result of any change after the date it became a Lender under this agreement in (or in the interpretation, administration, or application of) any law or Treaty, or any published practice or published concession of any relevant taxing authority; or
2. the relevant Lender is a Qualifying Lender solely by virtue of paragraph (ii) of the definition of "Qualifying Lender"; and

2. (B) the payment could have been made to the Lender without any Tax Deduction if that Direction had not been made;

(iii) the relevant Lender is a Qualifying Lender solely by virtue of paragraph (ii) of the definition of "Qualifying Lender" and:

- (A) the relevant Lender has not given a Tax Confirmation to the Parent; and
- (B) the payment could have been made to the Lender without any Tax Deduction if the Lender had given a Tax Confirmation to the Parent, on the basis that the Tax Confirmation would have enabled the Parent to have formed a reasonable belief that the payment was an "excepted payment" for the purpose of section 930 of the ITA; or

(iv) the relevant Lender is a Treaty Lender and the Obligor making the payment is able to demonstrate that the payment could have been made to the Lender without the Tax Deduction had that Lender complied with its obligations under paragraph (g) or (h) (as applicable) below.

(v) for the avoidance of doubt, the Tax Deduction relates to a Tax described in clause 17.3(b) (Tax Indemnity) or is a FATCA Deduction.
