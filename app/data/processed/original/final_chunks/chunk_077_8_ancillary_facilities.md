<!-- Length: 1738 characters -->
(d) Where this agreement or any other Senior Finance Document imposes an obligation on a Borrower under an Ancillary Facility and the relevant Borrower is an Affiliate of a Borrower which is not a party to that document, the relevant Borrower shall ensure that the obligation is performed by its Affiliate.

(e) Any reference in this agreement or any other Senior Finance Document to a Borrower being under no obligations (whether actual or contingent) as a Borrower under such Senior Finance Document shall be construed to include a reference to any Affiliate of a Borrower being under no obligations under any Senior Finance Document or Ancillary Document.

(f) If any Affiliate of a Borrower becomes a borrower of an Ancillary Facility, the relevant Borrower shall procure that such Affiliate accedes to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) no later than contemporaneously with the date on which it becomes a borrower.

# 8.10 Revolving Facility Commitment Amounts

Notwithstanding any other term of this agreement, each Lender shall ensure that at all times its Revolving Facility Commitment is not less than:

(a) its Ancillary Commitment; or

(b) the Ancillary Commitment of its Affiliate.

# 8.11 Amendments and Waivers - Ancillary Facilities

No amendment or waiver of a term of any Ancillary Facility shall require the consent of any Senior Finance Party other than the relevant Ancillary Lender unless such amendment or waiver itself relates to or gives rise to a matter which would require an amendment of or under this agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, under this clause 8 (Ancillary Facilities)). In such a case, clause 40 (Amendments and Waivers) will apply.
