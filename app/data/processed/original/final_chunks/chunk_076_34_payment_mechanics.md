34. PAYMENT MECHANICS

# 34.1 Payments to the Facility Agent

(a) On each date on which an Obligor or a Lender is required to make a payment under a Senior Finance Document, excluding a payment under the terms of an Ancillary Document that Obligor or Lender shall make the same available to the Facility Agent (unless a contrary indication appears in a Senior Finance Document) for value on the due date at the time and in such funds specified by the Facility Agent as being customary at the time for settlement of transactions in the relevant currency in the place of payment.

(b) Payment shall be made to such account in the principal financial centre of the country of that currency (or, in relation to euro, in a principal financial centre in such Participating Member State or London, as specified by the Facility Agent) and with such bank as the Facility Agent, in each case, specifies.

# 34.2 Distributions by the Facility Agent

Each payment received by the Facility Agent under the Senior Finance Documents for another Party shall, subject to clause 34.3 (Distributions to an Obligor) and clause 34.4 (Clawback and Pre-Funding) be made available by the Facility Agent as soon as practicable after receipt to the Party entitled to receive payment in accordance with this agreement (in the case of a Lender, for the account of its Facility Office), to such account as that Party may notify to the Facility Agent by not less than five Business Days' notice with a bank specified by that Party in the principal financial centre of the country of that currency (or, in relation to euro, in the principal financial centre of a Participating Member State or London, as specified by that Party).

# 34.3 Distributions to an Obligor

The Facility Agent may (with the consent of the Obligor or in accordance with clause 35 (Set-Off)) apply any amount received by it for that Obligor in or towards payment (on the date and in the currency and funds of receipt) of any amount due from that Obligor under the Senior Finance Documents or in or towards purchase of any amount of any currency to be so applied.

# 34.4 Clawback and Pre-Funding

(a) Where a sum is to be paid to the Facility Agent under the Senior Finance Documents for another Party, the Facility Agent is not obliged to pay that sum to that other Party (or to enter into or perform any related exchange contract) until it has been able to establish to its satisfaction that it has actually received that sum.

(b) Unless paragraph (c) below applies, if the Facility Agent pays an amount to another Party and it proves to be the case that the Facility Agent had not actually received that amount, then the Party to whom that amount (or the proceeds of any related exchange contract) was paid by the Facility Agent shall on demand refund the same to the Facility Agent together with interest on that amount from the date of payment to the date of receipt by the Facility Agent, calculated by the Facility Agent to reflect its cost of funds.

(c) If the Facility Agent has notified the Lenders that it is willing to make available amounts for the account of a Borrower before receiving funds from the Lenders then if and to the extent that the Facility Agent does so but it proves to be the case that it does not then receive funds from a Lender in respect of a sum which it paid to a Borrower:

(i) the Facility Agent shall notify the Parent of that Lender's identity and the Borrower to whom that sum was made available shall on demand refund it to the Facility Agent; and

(ii) the Lender by whom those funds should have been made available or, if that Lender fails to do so, the Borrower to whom that sum was made available, shall on demand pay to the Facility Agent the amount (as certified by the Facility Agent) which will indemnify the Facility Agent against any funding cost incurred by it as a result of paying out that sum before receiving those funds from that Lender.

# 34.5 Impaired Agent

(a) If, at any time, the Facility Agent becomes an Impaired Agent, an Obligor or a Lender which is required to make a payment under the Senior Finance Documents to the Facility Agent in accordance with clause 34.1 (Payments to the Facility Agent) may instead either:

(i) pay that amount direct to the required recipient(s); or

(ii) if in its absolute discretion it considers that it is not reasonably practicable to pay that amount direct to the required recipient(s), pay that amount or the relevant part of that amount to an interest-bearing account held with an Acceptable Bank within the meaning of paragraph (a) of the definition of "Acceptable Bank" and in relation to which no Insolvency Event has occurred and is continuing, in the name of the Obligor or the Lender making the payment (the "Paying Party") and designated as a trust account for the benefit of the Party or Parties beneficially entitled to that payment under the Senior Finance Documents (the "Recipient Party" or "Recipient Parties").

In each case such payments must be made on the due date for payment under the Senior Finance Documents.

(b) All interest accrued on the amount standing to the credit of the trust account shall be for the benefit of the Recipient Party or the Recipient Parties pro rata to their respective entitlements.

(c) A Party which has made a payment in accordance with this clause 34.5 shall be discharged of the relevant payment obligation under the Senior Finance Documents and shall not take any credit risk with respect to the amounts standing to the credit of the trust account.

(d) Promptly upon the appointment of a successor Facility Agent in accordance with clause 31.13 (Replacement of the Facility Agent), each Paying Party shall (other than to the extent that that Party has given an instruction pursuant to paragraph (e) below) give all requisite instructions to the bank with whom the trust account is held to transfer the amount (together with any accrued interest) to the successor Facility Agent for distribution to the relevant Recipient Party or Recipient Parties in accordance with clause 34.2 (Distributions by the Facility Agent).

(e) A Paying Party shall, promptly upon request by a Recipient Party and to the extent:

(i) that it has not given an instruction pursuant to paragraph (d) above; and

(ii) that it has been provided with the necessary information by that Recipient Party,

give all requisite instructions to the bank with whom the trust account is held to transfer the relevant amount (together with any accrued interest) to that Recipient Party.

# 34.6 Partial Payments

(a) If the Facility Agent receives a payment for application against amounts due in respect of any Senior Finance Documents that is insufficient to discharge all the amounts then due and payable by an Obligor under those Senior Finance Documents, the Facility Agent shall (to the extent permitted by applicable law) apply that payment towards the obligations of that Obligor under those Senior Finance Documents in the following order:

(i) first, in or towards payment pro rata of any unpaid amount owing to the Facility Agent or the Security Agent under those Senior Finance Documents;

(ii) secondly, in or towards payment pro rata of any accrued interest, fee or commission due but unpaid under those Senior Finance Documents;

# 34.6 Application of Proceeds

(iii) thirdly, in or towards payment pro rata of any principal due but unpaid under those Senior Finance Documents; and

(iv) fourthly, in or towards payment pro rata of any other sum due but unpaid under the Senior Finance Documents.

(b) The Facility Agent shall, if so directed by the Majority Lenders and, if that direction affects any payment to the Revolving Facility Lenders, the Majority Revolving Facility Lenders, vary the order set out in paragraphs (a)(ii) to (iv) above.

(c) Paragraphs (a) and (b) above will override any appropriation made by an Obligor.

(d) Notwithstanding this clause 34.6, upon the occurrence of any event listed in clause 11.1 (Exit), any proceeds received shall be applied in accordance with clause 17 (Application of Proceeds) of the Intercreditor Agreement.

# 34.7 No Set-Off by Obligors

Save where specifically provided for in any Ancillary Facility, all payments to be made by an Obligor under the Senior Finance Documents shall be calculated and be made without (and free and clear of any deduction for) set-off or counterclaim.

# 34.8 Business Days

(a) Any payment under the Senior Finance Documents which is due to be made on a day that is not a Business Day shall be made on the next Business Day in the same calendar month (if there is one) or the preceding Business Day (if there is not).

(b) During any extension of the due date for payment of any principal or Unpaid Sum under this agreement interest is payable on the principal or Unpaid Sum at the rate payable on the original due date.

# 34.9 Currency of Account

(a) Subject to paragraphs (b) to (e) (inclusive) below, the Base Currency is the currency of account and payment for any sum due from an Obligor under any Senior Finance Document.

(b) A repayment or prepayment of a Utilisation or Unpaid Sum or a part of a Utilisation or Unpaid Sum shall be made in the currency in which that Utilisation or Unpaid Sum is denominated, pursuant to this agreement, on its due date.

(c) Each payment of interest shall be made in the currency in which the sum in respect of which the interest is payable was denominated, pursuant to this agreement, when that interest accrued.

(d) Each payment in respect of costs, expenses or Taxes shall be made in the currency in which the costs, expenses or Taxes are incurred.

(e) Any amount expressed to be payable in a currency other than the Base Currency shall be paid in that other currency.

# 34.10 Change of Currency

(a) Unless otherwise prohibited by law, if more than one currency or currency unit are at the same time recognised by the central bank of any country as the lawful currency of that country, then:

UK - 205885966.10 174

(i) any reference in the Senior Finance Documents to, and any obligations arising under the Senior Finance Documents in, the currency of that country shall be translated into, or paid in, the currency or currency unit of that country designated by the Facility Agent (after consultation with the Parent); and

(ii) any translation from one currency or currency unit to another shall be at the official rate of exchange recognised by the central bank for the conversion of that currency or currency unit into the other, rounded up or down by the Facility Agent (acting reasonably).

(b) If a change in any currency of a country occurs, this agreement will, to the extent the Facility Agent (acting reasonably and after consultation with the Parent) specifies to be necessary, be amended to comply with any generally accepted conventions and market practice in the Relevant Interbank Market and otherwise to reflect the change in currency.

# 34.11 Disruption to Payment Systems etc.

If either the Facility Agent determines (in its discretion) that a Disruption Event has occurred or the Facility Agent is notified by the Parent that a Disruption Event has occurred:

(a) the Facility Agent may, and shall if requested to do so by the Parent, consult with the Parent with a view to agreeing with the Parent such changes to the operation or administration of the Facilities as the Facility Agent may deem necessary in the circumstances;
