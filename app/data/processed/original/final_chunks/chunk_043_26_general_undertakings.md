the amount of any excess being the "Cash Balance") and any such Cash Balance shall be upstreamed (whether by way of loan, repayment of debt, payment of interest, dividend or otherwise) by such member of the Group (which is not an Obligor) to an Obligor (other than the Parent) incorporated in England and Wales.

(b) No Obligor shall be obliged at any time to procure that a Subsidiary upstream any Cash Balance under paragraph (a) above:

- (i) at a time when to do so would cause the Obligor or the Subsidiary (despite that person using all reasonable efforts to avoid the relevant Tax liability) to incur a Tax liability in respect of the Cash Balance equal to or greater than 5 per cent of the amount of the loan or transfer; or
- (ii) if (despite using all reasonable efforts to avoid the breach or result) to do so would breach any applicable law or result in personal liability for any Obligor, such Subsidiary or its directors.

# 26.34 Treasury Transactions

No Obligor shall (and the Parent will procure that no other Group Company will) enter into any Treasury Transaction, other than:

- (a) the hedging transactions documented by the Hedging Agreements;
- (b) any Hedging Agreement for the purposes of hedging interest rate liabilities under the CAR Facility (including, without limitation, any hedging entered into pursuant to the Hedging Letter) and any arrangement replacing or extending such Hedging Agreement on terms permitted by the Senior Finance Documents, up to the Termination Date of the CAR Facility and, in each case, entered into with a counterparty which, at the time of entering into such Hedging Agreement, is a Lender;
- (c) spot and forward delivery foreign exchange contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business and not for speculative purposes;

(d) any Treasury Transaction entered into for the hedging of actual or projected real exposures arising in the ordinary course of trading activities of a Group Company and not for speculative purposes; and

(e) with a Senior Finance Party.

# 26.35 Compliance with Hedging Letter

The Parent shall ensure that all exchange rate and interest rate hedging arrangements required by the Hedging Letter are implemented in accordance with the terms of the Hedging Letter and that such arrangements are not terminated, varied or cancelled without the consent of the Facility Agent (acting on the instructions of the Majority Lenders), save as permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement.

# 26.36 Guarantors

(a) Subject to paragraph (b) below, clause 26.38(e) (Conditions Subsequent) and the Agreed Security Principles, the Parent shall ensure that at all times after the Closing Date, the aggregate EBITDA (as defined in clause 25 (Financial Covenants)) of those of the Guarantors with positive EBITDA and the aggregate gross assets of those of the Guarantors with positive net worth (in each case calculated on an unconsolidated basis and excluding all intra-group items and investments in Subsidiaries of any Group Company) represents not less than 85 per cent of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in clause 25 (Financial Covenants)) and consolidated gross assets of the Group (ignoring, for the purposes of consolidation, those Group Companies with zero or negative EBITDA or no net assets).

(b) The Parent need only perform its obligations under paragraph (a) above if it is not unlawful for the relevant person to become a Guarantor and that person becoming a Guarantor would not result in personal liability for that person's directors or other management. Each Obligor must use, and must procure that the relevant person uses, all reasonable endeavours lawfully available to avoid any such unlawfulness or personal liability. This includes agreeing to a limit on the amount guaranteed. The Facility Agent may (but shall not be obliged to) agree to such a limit if, in its opinion, to do so would avoid the relevant unlawfulness or personal liability.

# 26.37 Further Assurance

(a) Subject to the Agreed Security Principles each Obligor shall (and the Parent shall procure that each other Group Company will) at its own expense promptly do all such acts or execute all such documents (including assignments, transfers, mortgages, charges, notices and instructions) as the Security Agent may reasonably specify (and in such form as the Security Agent may reasonably require in favour of the Security Agent or its nominee(s)):

- (i) to perfect the Security created or intended to be created under or evidenced by the Transaction Security Documents (which may include the execution of a mortgage, charge, assignment or other Security over all or any of the assets which are, or are intended to be, the subject of the Transaction Security) or for the exercise of any rights, powers and remedies of the Security Agent or the Senior Finance Parties provided by or pursuant to the Senior Finance Documents or by law;
- (ii) to confer on the Security Agent or confer on the Senior Finance Parties Security over any property and assets of that Obligor located in any jurisdiction equivalent or similar to the Security intended to be conferred by or pursuant to the Transaction Security Documents; and/or

(iii) to facilitate the realisation of the assets which are, or are intended to be, the subject of the Transaction Security.

(b) Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, each Obligor shall (and the Parent shall procure that, each other Group Company will) take all such action as is available to it (including making all filings and registrations) as may be necessary for the purpose of the creation, perfection, protection or maintenance of any Security conferred or intended to be conferred on the Security Agent or the Senior Finance Parties by or pursuant to the Senior Finance Documents.

(c) Prior to any payment being made to a Holding Account or Mandatory Prepayment Account, the Parent will establish and provide a letter from the Parent to the Facility Agent specifying the Holding Account and the Mandatory Prepayment Account including details of each account name, account number and the name and address of the bank where each account is held.

(d) The Parent will, within 5 Business Days deliver notices of assignment or charge to be sent under the Transaction Security Documents executed on behalf of each relevant Original Obligor in relation to the insurance policies of the Group.

(a) Directly or indirectly (as far as it is aware) use the proceeds from any Loan, or lend, contribute or otherwise make available such proceeds to any Subsidiary, joint venture partner or other person that is the subject of any Sanctions:

- (i) to fund any activities or business of or with any person that at the time of such funding is the subject of Sanctions, or fund any activities or business in any country or territory subject to Sanctions or any person located in such a country or territory; or
