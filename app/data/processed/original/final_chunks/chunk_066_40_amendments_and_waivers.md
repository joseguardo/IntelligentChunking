2. whether:
3.
any given percentage (including, for the avoidance of doubt, unanimity) of the Total Commitments under the relevant Facility/ies; or
4. the agreement of any specified group of Lenders,

has been obtained to approve any request for a consent, waiver, amendment or other vote of Lenders under the Senior Finance Documents, that Defaulting Lender's Commitments under the relevant Facility/ies will be reduced by the amount of its Available Commitments under the relevant Facility/ies and, to the extent that that reduction results in that Defaulting Lender's Total Commitments being zero, that Defaulting Lender shall be deemed not to be a Lender for the purposes of paragraphs (i) and (ii) above.
