SCHEDULE 10

# Agreed Security Principles

# 1. THE PRINCIPLES

The guarantees and Security to be provided in support of the Facilities (and any related hedging arrangements In respect of the types of liabilities and/or risks which the Hedging Letter requires to be hedged) will be given in accordance with the agreed security principles set out in this schedule.

# 2. POTENTIAL RESTRICTIONS ON CREDIT SUPPORT

The Agreed Security Principles recognise that there may be legal and practical difficulties in obtaining security from all Obligors in every jurisdiction in which Obligors are incorporated or operate. In particular:

- (a) general statutory limitations, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, thin capitalisation rules, capital maintenance, exchange control restrictions, retention of title claims and similar principles may limit the ability of a member of the Group to provide a guarantee or grant security or may require that its guarantee be limited in amount or scope. The Parent will use all reasonable endeavours to assist in demonstrating that adequate corporate benefit accrues to the Target and each Obligor;
- (b) the Security and extent of its perfection will be agreed taking into account the economic cost to the Group of providing Security and the proportionate benefit accruing to the Lenders having regard to the extent of the obligations which can be secured by that Security and the priority that will be offered by taking or perfecting the Security;
- (c) any assets subject to pre-existing third party arrangements which are permitted by this agreement and which prevent those assets from being charged will be excluded from any relevant Transaction Security Document but the Obligors must use reasonable endeavours to obtain consent to charging any such assets if the relevant asset is material;
- (d) Guarantors will not be required to give guarantees or enter into security documents if that would conflict with the mandatory fiduciary duties of their or any Affiliates' directors or contravene any legal prohibition or result in a risk of personal or criminal liability on the part of any officer or member of such company provided that the relevant Guarantor shall use reasonable endeavours to overcome any such obstacle to the extent that that can be done at reasonable cost;
- (e) Guarantors will not be required to give guarantees or enter into Security where the Guarantor can demonstrate that there would be a significant Tax cost disadvantage in doing so such that the cost of giving such guarantees or entering into such Security would be disproportionate to the benefit of such guarantee and/or Security to the Lenders, provided that the relevant Guarantor shall use reasonable endeavours to overcome any such obstacle to the extent that can be done at reasonable cost;
- (f) perfection of Security, when required, and other legal formalities will be completed as soon as practicable and, in any event, within the time periods specified in the Senior Finance Documents therefore or (If earlier or to the extent no such time periods are specified in the Senior Finance Documents) within the time periods specified by applicable law in order to ensure due perfection;

UK - 205885966.10                                        221

(g) the perfection of Security granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect on the commercial reputation of the relevant Guarantor or on its ability to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise not prohibited by the Senior Finance Documents;

(h) access to the assets of a Guarantor, the maximum guaranteed or secured amount may be restricted or limited by guarantee limitation language agreed to reflect these principles and to the extent consistent with them, customary practice in the relevant jurisdiction to minimise stamp duty, notarisation, registration or other applicable fees where the economic benefit of increasing the guaranteed or secured amount is disproportionate to the level of such fees, Taxes and duties or where registration, notarial or other fees are payable by reference to the stated amount secured in which case, any asset Security granted by that Guarantor shall be limited to the maximum recoverable amount under the guarantee;

(i) where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of granting Security over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such Security, Security will be granted over the material assets only;

(j) unless granted under a global security document governed by the law of the jurisdiction of a Guarantor or under English law all Security (other than share Security over its Guarantor subsidiaries) shall be governed by the law of and secure assets located in the jurisdiction of incorporation of that Guarantor;

(k) no perfection action will be required in jurisdictions where Guarantors are not located (other than in relation to any security over shares or equity interests or in intellectual property) but perfection action may be required in the jurisdiction of one Obligor in relation to security granted by an Obligor located in a different jurisdiction;

(l) to the extent possible, the Security Agent will hold one set of security for the Lenders and the Hedge Counterparties;

(m) Security over intellectual property rights will be taken on an "as is, where is" basis, and members of the Group will not be required to procure any changes to or corrections of filings on external registers;

# 3. GUARANTEES

To the extent legally permitted and subject to paragraph 2 above, each guarantee and security will be an upstream, cross-stream and downstream guarantee and each guarantee and security will be for all liabilities of the Obligors under the Senior Finance Documents.

# 4. SECURITY PERFECTION

Security will be for all liabilities of the relevant grantor (including its liabilities in respect of any guarantee) under the Senior Finance Documents in accordance with, and subject to, the requirements of the Agreed Security Principles in each relevant jurisdiction.

To the extent possible, all Security shall be given in favour of the Security Agent as agent for the Senior Finance Parties and not the Finance Parties individually. "Parallel debt" provisions will be used where necessary and not in cases where local law does not require this concept; such provisions will be contained in the Intercreditor Agreement and not the individual Transaction Security Documents unless required under local laws. To the extent possible, there should be no action required to be taken in relation to the guarantees or Security when any Lender transfers any of Its participation in the Facilities to a new Lender.

The Guarantors will be required to pay the cost of any re-execution, notarisation, re-registration, amendment or other perfection requirement for any Security on any assignment or transfer by the Mandated Lead Arrangers to a new Lender and such cost or fee shall be for the account of the Obligors;

# 5. TERMS OF SECURITY DOCUMENTS

The following principles will be reflected In the terms of any Transaction Security:
