(f) Within 30 days of making either a Tax Deduction or any payment required in connection with that Tax Deduction, the Obligor making that Tax Deduction shall deliver to the Facility Agent for the Senior Finance Party entitled to the payment a statement under section 975 of the ITA or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to that Senior Finance Party that the Tax Deduction has been made or (as applicable) any appropriate payment paid to the relevant taxing authority.

(g) (i) Subject to paragraph (ii) below, a Treaty Lender and each Obligor which makes a payment to which that Treaty Lender is entitled shall co-operate in completing any procedural formalities necessary for that Obligor to obtain authorisation to make that payment without a Tax Deduction.

- (ii) (A) A Treaty Lender which becomes a Party on the day on which this agreement is entered into that holds a passport under the HMRC DT Treaty Passport scheme, and which wishes that scheme to apply to this agreement, shall confirm its scheme reference number and its jurisdiction of tax residence opposite its name in part 2 of schedule 1 (The Original Parties); and
- (B) a New Lender, CAR Facility Lender or an Increase Lender that is a Treaty Lender that holds a passport under the HMRC DT Treaty Passport scheme, and which wishes that scheme to apply to this agreement, shall confirm its scheme reference number and its jurisdiction of tax residence in the Transfer Certificate, Assignment Agreement, CAR Facility Establishment Notice or Increase Confirmation which it executes, and, having done so, that Lender shall be under no obligation pursuant to paragraph (i) above.

(h) If a Lender has confirmed its scheme reference number and its jurisdiction of tax residence in accordance with paragraph (g)(ii) above and:

- (i) a Borrower making a payment to that Lender has not made a Borrower DTTP Filing in respect of that Lender; or

(ii) a Borrower making a payment to that Lender has made a Borrower DTTP Filing in respect of that Lender but:

- (A) that Borrower DTTP Filing has been rejected by HM Revenue & Customs; or
- (B) HM Revenue & Customs has not given the Borrower authority to make payments to that Lender without a Tax Deduction within 60 days of the date of the Borrower DTTP Filing,

and in each case, the Borrower has notified that Lender in writing, that Lender and the Borrower shall co-operate in completing any additional procedural formalities necessary for that Borrower to obtain authorisation to make that payment without a Tax Deduction.

(i) If a Lender has not confirmed its scheme reference number and jurisdiction of tax residence in accordance with paragraph (g)(ii) above, no Obligor shall make a Borrower DTTP Filing or file any other form relating to the HMRC DT Treaty Passport scheme in respect of that Lender's Commitment(s) or its participation in any Utilisation unless the Lender otherwise agrees.

(j) A Borrower shall, promptly on making a Borrower DTTP Filing, deliver a copy of that Borrower DTTP Filing to the Facility Agent for delivery to the relevant Lender.

# 17.3 Tax Indemnity

(a) The Parent shall (within three Business Days of demand by the Facility Agent) pay to a Protected Party an amount equal to the loss, liability or cost which that Protected Party determines will be or has been (directly or indirectly) suffered for or on account of Tax by that Protected Party in respect of a Senior Finance Document.

(b) Paragraph (a) above shall not apply:

- (i) with respect to any Tax assessed on a Senior Finance Party:
- - (A) under the law of the jurisdiction in which that Senior Finance Party is incorporated or, if different, the jurisdiction (or jurisdictions) in which that Senior Finance Party is treated as resident for tax purposes; or
- (B) under the law of the jurisdiction in which that Senior Finance Party's Facility Office is located in respect of amounts received or receivable in that jurisdiction,

if that Tax is imposed on or calculated by reference to the net income received or receivable (but not any sum deemed to be received or receivable) by that Senior Finance Party; or

(ii) to the extent a loss, liability or cost:

# 17.3 Tax Indemnity

because one of the exclusions in clause 17.2(d) (Tax Gross-up) applied;

(C) results from a failure of the Senior Finance Party to comply with its obligations under clause 17.5 (Lender Status Confirmation); or

(D) relates to a FATCA Deduction required to be made by a Party.

(c) A Protected Party making, or intending to make a claim under paragraph (a) above shall promptly notify the Facility Agent of the event which will give, or has given, rise to the claim, following which the Facility Agent shall notify the Parent.

(d) A Protected Party shall, on receiving a payment from an Obligor under this clause 17.3 (Tax Indemnity), notify the Facility Agent.

# 17.4 Tax Credit

If an Obligor makes a Tax Payment and the relevant Senior Finance Party determines that:

(a) a Tax Credit is attributable to an increased payment of which that Tax Payment forms part, to that Tax Payment or to a Tax Deduction in consequence of which that Tax Payment was required; and

(b) that Senior Finance Party has obtained and utilised that Tax Credit,

the Senior Finance Party shall pay the amount of such Tax Credit to the Obligor net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such Senior Finance Party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant governmental authority with respect to such Tax Credit) which that Senior Finance Party determines will leave it (after that payment) in the same after-Tax position as it would have been in had the Tax Payment not been required to be made by the Obligor. Such Obligor, within 3 Business Days following the request of such Senior Finance Party, shall repay to such Senior Finance Party the amount paid over to it pursuant to this clause 17.4 (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant governmental authority) in the event that such Senior Finance Party is required to repay such Tax Credit to such governmental authority.

# 17.5 Lender Status Confirmation

Each Lender which becomes a Party to this agreement after the date of this agreement shall indicate, in the Transfer Certificate, Assignment Agreement, CAR Facility Establishment Notice or Increase Confirmation which it executes on becoming a Party, and for the benefit of the Facility Agent and without liability to any Obligor, which of the following categories it falls in:

(a) not a Qualifying Lender;

(b) a Qualifying Lender (other than a Treaty Lender); or

(c) a Treaty Lender.

If a New Lender, CAR Facility Lender or an Increase Lender fails to indicate its status in accordance with this clause 17.5 then such New Lender, CAR Facility Lender or Increase Lender shall be treated for the purposes of this agreement (including by each Obligor) as if it is not a Qualifying Lender until such time as it notifies the Facility Agent which category applies (and the Facility Agent, upon receipt of such notification, shall inform the Parent). For the avoidance of doubt, a Transfer Certificate, Assignment Agreement, CAR Facility Establishment Notice or Increase Confirmation shall not be invalidated by any failure of a Lender to comply with this clause 17.5.

# 17.6 Stamp Taxes

The Parent shall pay and, within three Business Days of demand, indemnify each Senior Finance Party and Arranger against any cost, loss or liability that Senior Finance Party or Arranger incurs in relation to all stamp duty, registration and other similar Taxes payable in respect of any Senior Finance Document.

# 17.7 VAT

(a) All amounts expressed to be payable under a Senior Finance Document by any Party to a Senior Finance Party which (in whole or in part) constitute the consideration for any supply for VAT purposes are deemed to be exclusive of any VAT which is chargeable on that supply, and accordingly, subject to paragraph (b) below, if VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Senior Finance Party to any Party under a Senior Finance Document and such Senior Finance Party is required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT, that Party must pay to such Senior Finance Party (in addition to and at the same time as paying any other consideration for such supply) an amount equal to the amount of the VAT (and such Senior Finance Party must promptly provide an appropriate VAT invoice to that Party).

(b) If VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Senior Finance Party (the "Supplier") to any other Senior Finance Party (the "Recipient") under a Senior Finance Document, and any Party other than the Recipient (the "Relevant Party") is required by the terms of any Senior Finance Document to pay an amount equal to the consideration for that supply to the Supplier (rather than being required to reimburse or indemnify the Recipient in respect of that consideration):

(i) (where the Supplier is the person required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT) the Relevant Party must also pay to the Supplier (at the same time as paying that amount) an additional amount equal to the amount of the VAT. The Recipient must (where this paragraph (i) applies) promptly pay to the Relevant Party an amount equal to any credit or repayment the Recipient receives from the relevant tax authority which the Recipient reasonably determines relates to the VAT chargeable on that supply; and

(ii) (where the Recipient is the person required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT) the Relevant Party must promptly, following demand from the Recipient, pay to the Recipient an amount equal to the VAT chargeable on that supply but only to the extent that the Recipient reasonably determines that it is not entitled to credit or repayment from the relevant tax authority in respect of that VAT.

(c) Where a Senior Finance Document requires any Party to reimburse or indemnify a Senior Finance Party for any cost or expense, that Party shall reimburse or indemnify (as the case may be) such Senior Finance Party for the full amount of such cost or expense, including such part thereof as represents VAT, save to the extent that such Senior Finance Party reasonably determines that it is entitled to credit or repayment in respect of such VAT from the relevant tax authority.

(d) Any reference in this clause 17.7 to any Party shall, at any time when such Party is treated as a member of a group for VAT purposes, include (where appropriate and unless the context otherwise requires) a reference to the representative member of such group at such time (the term "representative member" to have the same meaning as in the Value Added Tax Act 1994 or in any equivalent legislation of another jurisdiction).

# 17.8 FATCA Information

(a) Subject to paragraph (c) below, each Party shall, within ten Business Days of a reasonable request by another Party:

- (i) confirm to that other Party whether it is:
- - (A) a FATCA Exempt Party; or
- (B) not a FATCA Exempt Party; and
