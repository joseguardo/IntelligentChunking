15. CHANGES TO THE CALCULATION OF INTEREST

# 15.1 Absence of Quotations

Subject to clause 15.2 (Market Disruption), if LIBOR or, if applicable, EURIBOR is to be determined by reference to the Base Reference Bank Rate but a Base Reference Bank does not supply a quotation by the Specified Time on the Quotation Day, the applicable LIBOR or EURIBOR shall be determined on the basis of the quotations of the remaining Base Reference Banks.

# 15.2 Market Disruption

(a) If a Market Disruption Event occurs in relation to a Loan for any Interest Period, then the rate of interest on each Lender's share of that Loan for the Interest Period shall be the percentage rate per annum which is the sum of:

- (i) the Margin; and
- (ii) the rate notified to the Facility Agent by that Lender as soon as practicable and in any event by close of business on the date falling five Business Days after the Quotation Day (or, if earlier, on the date falling five Business Days prior to the date on which interest is due to be paid in respect of that Interest Period), to be that which expresses as a percentage rate per annum the cost to that Lender of funding its participation in that Loan from whatever source it may reasonably select.

(b) If:

- (i) the percentage rate per annum notified by a Lender pursuant to paragraph (a)(ii) above is less than LIBOR or, in relation to any Loan in euro, EURIBOR; or
- (ii) a Lender has not notified the Facility Agent of a percentage rate per annum pursuant to paragraph (a)(ii) above,

the cost to that Lender of funding its participation in that Loan for that Interest Period shall be deemed, for the purposes of paragraph (a) above, to be LIBOR or in relation to a loan in euro, EURIBOR.

(c) If a Market Disruption Event occurs the Facility Agent shall, as soon as is practicable, notify the Parent.

(d) In this agreement:

"Market Disruption Event" means:

- (i) at or about noon on the Quotation Day for the relevant Interest Period LIBOR or, if applicable, EURIBOR is to be determined by reference to the

Base Reference Banks and none or only one of the Base Reference Banks supplies a rate to the Facility Agent to determine LIBOR or, if applicable, EURIBOR for the relevant currency and Interest Period; or

(ii) before close of business in London on the Quotation Day for the relevant Interest Period, the Facility Agent receives notifications from a Lender or Lenders (whose participations in a Loan exceed 35 per cent of that Loan) that the cost to it of funding its participation in that Loan from whatever source it may reasonably select would be in excess of LIBOR or, if applicable, EURIBOR.

# 15.3 Alternative Basis of Interest or Funding

(a) If a Market Disruption Event occurs and the Facility Agent or the Parent so requires, the Facility Agent and the Parent shall enter into negotiations (for a period of not more than 30 days) with a view to agreeing a substitute basis for determining the rate of interest.

(b) Any alternative basis agreed pursuant to paragraph (a) above shall, with the prior consent of all the Lenders and the Parent, be binding on all Parties.

# 15.4 Break Costs

(a) Each Borrower shall, within three Business Days of demand by a Senior Finance Party, pay to that Senior Finance Party its Break Costs attributable to all or any part of a Loan or Unpaid Sum being paid by that Borrower on a day other than the last day of an Interest Period for that Loan or Unpaid Sum.

(b) Each Lender shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after a demand by the Facility Agent, provide a certificate confirming the amount of its Break Costs for any Interest Period in which they accrue.
