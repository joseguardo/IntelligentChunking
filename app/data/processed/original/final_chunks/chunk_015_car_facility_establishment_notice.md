(b) Unless a contrary indication appears, in this clause 17 (Tax Gross-up and Indemnities) a reference to "determines" or "determined" means a determination made in the absolute discretion of the person making the determination.

# 17.2 Tax Gross-up

(a) Each Obligor shall make all payments to be made by it without any Tax Deduction, unless a Tax Deduction is required by law.

(b) The Parent shall promptly upon becoming aware that an Obligor must make a Tax Deduction (or that there is any change in the rate or the basis of a Tax Deduction) notify the Facility Agent accordingly. Similarly a Lender shall notify the Facility Agent on becoming so aware in respect of a payment payable to that Lender. If the Facility Agent receives such notification from a Lender it shall notify the Parent and that Obligor.

(c) If a Tax Deduction is required by law to be made by an Obligor, the amount of the payment due from that Obligor shall be increased to an amount which (after making any Tax Deduction) leaves an amount equal to the payment which would have been due if no Tax Deduction had been required.

(d) A payment shall not be increased under paragraph (c) above by reason of a Tax Deduction on account of Tax imposed by the United Kingdom, if on the date on which the payment falls due:

1. the payment could have been made to the relevant Lender without a Tax Deduction if the Lender had been a Qualifying Lender, but on that date that Lender is not or has ceased to be a Qualifying Lender other than as a result of any change after the date it became a Lender under this agreement in (or in the interpretation, administration, or application of) any law or Treaty, or any published practice or published concession of any relevant taxing authority; or
2. the relevant Lender is a Qualifying Lender solely by virtue of paragraph (ii) of the definition of "Qualifying Lender"; and
1. (A) an officer of HM Revenue & Customs has given (and not revoked) a direction (a "Direction") under section 931 of the ITA which relates to the payment and that Lender has received from the Obligor making the payment or from the Parent a certified copy of that Direction; and
2. (B) the payment could have been made to the Lender without any Tax Deduction if that Direction had not been made;

# (iii)

the relevant Lender is a Qualifying Lender solely by virtue of paragraph (ii) of the definition of "Qualifying Lender" and:

- (A) the relevant Lender has not given a Tax Confirmation to the Parent; and
- (B) the payment could have been made to the Lender without any Tax Deduction if the Lender had given a Tax Confirmation to the Parent, on the basis that the Tax Confirmation would have enabled the Parent to have formed a reasonable belief that the payment was an "excepted payment" for the purpose of section 930 of the ITA; or

# (iv)

the relevant Lender is a Treaty Lender and the Obligor making the payment is able to demonstrate that the payment could have been made to the Lender without the Tax Deduction had that Lender complied with its obligations under paragraph (g) or (h) (as applicable) below.

# (v)

for the avoidance of doubt, the Tax Deduction relates to a Tax described in clause 17.3(b) (Tax Indemnity) or is a FATCA Deduction.

# (e)

If an Obligor is required to make a Tax Deduction, that Obligor shall make that Tax Deduction and any payment required in connection with that Tax Deduction within the time allowed and in the minimum amount required by law.

# (f)

Within 30 days of making either a Tax Deduction or any payment required in connection with that Tax Deduction, the Obligor making that Tax Deduction shall deliver to the Facility Agent for the Senior Finance Party entitled to the payment a statement under section 975 of the ITA or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to that Senior Finance Party that the Tax Deduction has been made or (as applicable) any appropriate payment paid to the relevant taxing authority.

# (g)

(i) Subject to paragraph (ii) below, a Treaty Lender and each Obligor which makes a payment to which that Treaty Lender is entitled shall co-operate in completing any procedural formalities necessary for that Obligor to obtain authorisation to make that payment without a Tax Deduction.

(ii)

- (A) A Treaty Lender which becomes a Party on the day on which this agreement is entered into that holds a passport under the HMRC DT Treaty Passport scheme, and which wishes that scheme to apply to this agreement, shall confirm its scheme reference number and its jurisdiction of tax residence opposite its name in part 2 of schedule 1 (
