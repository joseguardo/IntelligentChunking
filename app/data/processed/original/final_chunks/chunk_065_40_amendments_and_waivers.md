40. AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS

# 40.1 Intercreditor Agreement

This clause 40 is subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

# 40.2 Required Consents

(a) Subject to clauses 40.3 (All Lender Matters) to 40.7 (Excluded Commitments) (inclusive) and the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any term of the Senior Finance Documents may be amended or waived only with the consent of the Majority Lenders and the Parent and any such amendment or waiver will be binding on all Parties.

(b) The Facility Agent may effect, on behalf of any Senior Finance Party, any amendment or waiver permitted by this clause 40 (Amendments and Waivers).

(c) Without prejudice to the generality of paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) of clause 31.7 (Rights and Discretions), the Facility Agent may engage, pay for and rely on the services of lawyers in determining the consent level required for and effecting any amendment, waiver or consent under this agreement.

(d) Each Obligor agrees to any such amendment or waiver permitted by this clause 40 (Amendments and Waivers) which is agreed to by the Parent. This includes any amendment or waiver which would, but for this paragraph (d), require the consent of all of the Guarantors.

(e) If a decision of the Lenders is required, then each Lender which has Commitments in respect of which it is entitled to cast a vote or votes ("Eligible Commitments") may elect to vote all or only part of those Eligible Commitments and may also vote part of its Eligible Commitments in one way whilst voting another part of its Eligible Commitments in another way.

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, an amendment or waiver which requires the consent of all the Lenders requires 100 per cent of Eligible Commitments to be cast in favour and not merely all of the Lender institutions to vote in favour. The same principle applies mutatis mutandis to Majority Lender and Majority Revolving Facility Lender decision making.

# 40.3 All Lender Matters

An amendment, waiver or consent in relation to any term of any Senior Finance Document that has the effect of changing or which relates to:

- (a) the definition of "Hedge Counterparty", "Majority Lenders", "Majority Revolving Facility Lenders", "Material Company" and "Significant Disposal" in clause 1.1 (Definitions);
- (b) an extension to the date of payment of any amount under the Senior Finance Documents (other than in relation to clause 11 (Mandatory Prepayment and Cancellation));
- (c) a reduction in the Margin or a reduction in the amount of any payment of principal, interest, fees or commission payable under the Senior Finance Documents;
- (d) a change in the currency of payment of any amount under the Senior Finance Documents;
- (e) an increase in any Commitment or the Total Commitments, any extension of any Availability Period or any requirement that a cancellation of Commitments reduces the Commitments of the Lenders rateably under the relevant Facility;
- (f) a change to the Borrowers or Guarantors other than in accordance with clause 30 (Changes to the Obligors);
- (g) any provision which expressly requires the consent of all the Lenders;
- (h) the definition of "CAR Facility Maximum Amount" and/or Clause 3.4(a) (CAR Facility);
- (i) the definition of "CAR Facility Maximum Margin", Clauses 3.4(d) and/or Clauses 3.5 (CAR Facility) and 3.20 (Lender's right in relation to a CAR Facility);
- (j) clause 2.3 (Senior Finance Parties' Rights and Obligations), clause 11.3 (Application of Mandatory Prepayments and Cancellations), clause 12.10 (Application of Prepayments), clause 26.36 (Guarantors), clause 28 (Changes to the Lenders),

2. the Charged Property; or
3. the manner in which the proceeds of enforcement of the Transaction Security are distributed,

(l) the release of any guarantee and indemnity granted under clause 22 (Guarantee and Indemnity) or of any Transaction Security unless relating to a sale or disposal of an asset which is the subject of the Transaction Security where such sale or disposal is expressly permitted under this agreement or any other Senior Finance Document; or

# 40.4 Majority Revolving Facility Lender matters

An amendment, waiver or consent in relation to any term of any Senior Finance Document that has the effect of changing or which relates to:

1. a Material Event of Default, the definition of "Material Event of Default" or the definitions used therein;
2. the provisions of clause 24.1 (Financial statements) or clause 24.2 (Provision and Contents of Compliance Certificate) which has the effect of delaying the delivery of the financial statements or Compliance Certificate (as the case may be) referred to therein by more than 30 days (beyond the time limits contemplated by those provisions in their original form);
3. the definitions of "Permitted Security" or the provisions of clause 26.15 (Negative Pledge) to the extent that the effect of such amendment or waiver is to permit the incurrence of Security that ranks pari passu or in priority to the Revolving Facility and would be materially adverse to the interests of the Lenders under the Revolving Facility Lenders;
4. clause 27.6 (Insolvency), clause 27.7 (Insolvency Proceedings) or clause 27.8 (Creditors' Process) to the extent such change would be materially adverse to the interest of the Lenders under the Revolving Facility;

# 40.4 Majority Revolving Facility Lender matters

# 40.6 Other Exceptions

shall require the consent of the Majority Lenders and the Majority Revolving Lenders.

Any waiver of a Material Event of Default shall not require any consent of the Majority Lenders, provided that, where the event or circumstance that caused such Material Event of Default has also resulted in a Default, such Default may only be waived by the Majority Lenders, but for the avoidance of doubt any waiver of such Default by the Majority Lenders will not constitute a waiver of the corresponding Material Event of Default.

# 40.5 Approved List

(a) Subject to paragraph (b) below, the Approved List may be amended with the prior written consent of the Facility Agent (acting on the instruction of the Majority Lenders) and the Parent provided that the number of banks and financial institutions on the Approved List is not reduced at any time.

(b) The Parent may, subject to giving five Business Days prior notice to the Facility Agent, in its sole discretion:

- (i) add any new person to the Approved List at any time;
- (ii) remove up to three persons from the Approved List per Financial Year (but no more than five in aggregate during the life of the Facilities) provided that the Parent shall simultaneously add a new person (chosen by the Parent in its sole discretion) to the Approved List in place of each person removed;
- (iii) remove a potential transferee name from the Approved List where such potential transferee has been acquired by, has merged with or has otherwise combined its operations with, a person who is not included in the Approved List.

(c) Any person included in part 1 of the Approved List who has been acquired by, has merged with or has otherwise combined its operations with a person listed in part 2 of the Approved List or an affiliate of such person shall become considered as listed in part 2 of the Approved List.

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, an amendment to the Approved List will be without prejudice to the effect of any assignment or transfer which is made in accordance with clause 28 (Changes to the Lenders) prior to the date of such amendment.

(g) The Facility Agent shall make available the Approved List for review by a Lender or a prospective New Lender at its request for the purposes of verifying of such Lender's compliance with the provisions of this agreement.

# 40.6 Other Exceptions

(a) An amendment or waiver which relates to the rights or obligations of the Facility Agent, the Arranger, the Security Agent, any Ancillary Lender or a Hedge Counterparty (each in their capacity as such) may not be effected without the consent of the Facility Agent, the Arranger, the Security Agent, that Ancillary Lender or as the case may be, that Hedge Counterparty.

(b) Any manifest error in the Senior Finance Documents which is of a typographical nature may be amended by agreement between the Facility Agent and the Parent and any such amendment will be binding on all Parties.
