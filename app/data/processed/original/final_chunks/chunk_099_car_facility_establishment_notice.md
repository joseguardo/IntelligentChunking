# Lenders' right in relation to a CAR Facility

# 3.20

No later than 15 Business Days prior to establishing a CAR Facility, the Parent shall notify the Facility Agent in writing of its intention to establish a CAR Facility (or to increase the commitments under a CAR Facility which has already been established) and invite the Lenders in respect of Facility A to submit an offer in relation to such CAR Facility.

# 3.21

A Lender in respect of Facility A shall have the right (but not the obligation) to notify the Parent and the Facility Agent within 5 Business Days of receipt of the notice contained in clause 3.20 above of its decision whether or not to participate in the establishment of the CAR Facility requested by the Parent and, if applicable, the maximum amount of the CAR Facility Commitments it is willing to make available (a Lender so notifying the Parent and the Facility Agent being a "CAR Providing Lender").

# 3.22

No Lender in respect of Facility A is obliged to provide a CAR Facility (and the Parent is not obliged to accept an offer of a CAR Facility).

# 3.23

If 100 per cent of the CAR Facility Commitment is not allocated to CAR Providing Lenders, the Parent may offer any unallocated CAR Facility Commitments to other persons that would qualify as a New Lender under Clause 28.1 (Assignments and Transfers by the Lenders) selected by it in its sole discretion (not being a member of the Group or a Sponsor Affiliate) to participate in the establishment of such CAR Facility Commitments.
