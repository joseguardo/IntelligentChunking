# 28. CHANGES TO THE LENDERS

# 28.1 Assignments and Transfers by the Lenders

Subject to this clause 28 (Changes to the Lenders) and to clause 29 (Debt Purchase Transactions), a Lender (the "Existing Lender") may:

- (a) assign any of its rights or transfer by way of assignment and assumption any of its rights and obligations; or
- (b) transfer by novation any of its rights and obligations; or
- (c) sub-participate all or any of its rights or obligations,

under any Senior Finance Document to another bank or financial institution or to a trust, fund or other entity which is regularly engaged in or established for the purpose of making, purchasing or investing in loans, securities or other financial assets (the "New Lender") provided subject to Clause 28.2(b) (Conditions of Assignment, Transfer or Sub-participation) below always that as a consequence of any such assignment, transfer or sub-participation there are no more than, in aggregate, 6 Term Lenders (the "Syndicate Cap") and each New Lender's Commitments are at least £1,000,000 (or if the New Lenders are Related Funds the aggregate amount of their Commitments is at least £1,000,000). For the avoidance of doubt, for the purposes of this clause 28 (Changes to Lenders), any Affiliate or Related Fund of any Lender shall be treated as being a single Lender (in aggregate) for the purposes of calculating the Syndicate Cap.

# 28.2 Conditions of Assignment, Transfer or Sub-Participation

- (a) An Existing Lender must obtain the prior consent of the Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed and consent shall be deemed given if no response is received by the Existing Lender within 10 Business Days of consent being requested) before it may make an assignment, sub-participation or transfer in accordance with clause 28.1 (Assignments and Transfers by the Lenders) unless the assignment, transfer or sub-participation is:
- - (i) to another Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender;
- (ii) if the Existing Lender is a fund, to a fund which is a Related Fund of the Existing Lender;
- (iii) to an entity on the Approved List; or
- (iv) made at a time when an Event of Default is continuing.

(b) If an assignment or transfer in connection with any Senior Finance Document is made at a time when an Event of Default is continuing, the Syndicate Cap shall not apply and there shall be no limit on the number of Lenders. After any such Event of Default has been remedied or waived in writing, the Syndicate Cap shall be increased by the number of New Lenders who have become a New Lender pursuant to clause 28.1 (Assignments and Transfers by the Lenders) above whilst the relevant Event of Default was continuing.
- (c) Any request for consent made under paragraph (a) above must also be simultaneously sent to Jeremy Morgan at the following address jeremymorgan@sovereigncapital.co.uk.
- (d) Each assignment or transfer of any Lender's participation other than to an Affiliate or a Related Fund shall be in a minimum amount of £1,000,000 unless the

# Assignment and Transfer

(e) an assignment will only be effective on:

1. receipt by the Facility Agent (whether in the Assignment Agreement or otherwise) of written confirmation from the New Lender (in form and substance satisfactory to the Facility Agent) that the New Lender will assume the same obligations to the other Senior Finance Parties and the other Secured Parties as it would have been under if it was an Original Lender;
2. the New Lender entering into the documentation required for it to accede to the Intercreditor Agreement (which requirement will be satisfied on completion of an assignment using the form of Assignment Agreement attached as schedule 5 (Form of Assignment Agreement));
3. the performance by the Facility Agent (to the extent it thinks fit) of all necessary "know your customer" or other similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations in relation to such assignment to a New Lender, the completion of which the Facility Agent shall promptly notify to the Existing Lender and the New Lender.

(f) Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights and/or obligations (by whatever method) will be deemed to be subject (to the extent possible) to the rights and restrictions contained in the Intercreditor Agreement applicable to the Senior Lenders (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement). If the New Lender is not already a party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Senior Lender, then (for the benefit of the Senior Finance Parties) the New Lender agrees to become, with effect from the Transfer Date, a party to and agrees to be bound by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement as if it had originally been party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Senior Lender.

(g) A transfer will only be effective if the New Lender enters into the documentation required for it to accede as a party to the Intercreditor Agreement (which requirement will be satisfied on completion of a transfer using the form of Transfer Certificate attached as schedule 4 (Form of Transfer Certificate)) and if the procedure set out in clause 28.5 (Procedure for Transfer) is complied with.

(h) If:

1. a Lender assigns or transfers any of its rights or obligations under the Senior Finance Documents or changes its Facility Office; and
2. as a result of circumstances existing at the date the assignment, transfer or change occurs, an Obligor would be obliged to make a payment to the New Lender or Lender acting through its new Facility Office under clause 18 (Increased Costs),

then the New Lender or Lender acting through its new Facility Office is only entitled to receive payment under that clause to the same extent as the Existing Lender or Lender acting through its previous Facility Office would have been if the assignment, transfer or change had not occurred.

(i) Each New Lender, by executing the relevant Transfer Certificate or Assignment Agreement, confirms, for the avoidance of doubt, that the Facility Agent has authority to execute on its behalf any amendment or waiver that has been approved by or on behalf of the requisite Lender or Lenders in accordance with this agreement on or prior to the date on which the transfer or assignment becomes.

effective in accordance with this agreement and that it is bound by that decision to the same extent as the Existing Lender would have been had it remained a Lender.

# 28.3 Assignment or Transfer Fee

Unless the Facility Agent otherwise agrees, the New Lender shall, on the date upon which an assignment or transfer takes effect, pay to the Facility Agent (for its own account) a fee of £2,000.

# 28.4 Limitation of Responsibility of Existing Lenders

(a) Unless expressly agreed to the contrary, an Existing Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility to a New Lender for:

- (i) the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy or enforceability of the Transaction Documents, the Transaction Security or any other documents;
- (ii) the financial condition of any Obligor;
- (iii) the performance and observance by any Obligor or any other Group Company of its obligations under the Transaction Documents or any other documents; or
- (iv) the accuracy of any statements (whether written or oral) made in or in connection with any Transaction Document or any other document,

and any representations or warranties implied by law are excluded.

(b) Each New Lender confirms to the Existing Lender, the other Senior Finance Parties and the Secured Parties that it:

- (i) has made (and shall continue to make) its own independent investigation and assessment of the financial condition and affairs of each Obligor and its related entities in connection with its participation in this agreement and has not relied exclusively on any information provided to it by the Existing Lender or any other Senior Finance Party in connection with any Transaction Document or the Transaction Security; and
- (ii) will continue to make its own independent appraisal of the creditworthiness of each Obligor and its related entities whilst any amount is or may be outstanding under the Senior Finance Documents or any Commitment is in force.

(c) Nothing in any Senior Finance Document obliges an Existing Lender to:

- (i) accept a re-transfer or re-assignment from a New Lender of any of the rights and obligations assigned or transferred under this clause 28 (Changes to the Lenders); or
- (ii) support any losses directly or indirectly incurred by the New Lender by reason of the non-performance by any Obligor of its obligations under the Transaction Documents or otherwise.

# 28.5 Procedure for Transfer

(a) Subject to the conditions set out in clause 28.2 (Conditions of Assignment, Transfer or Sub-participation) a transfer is effected in accordance with paragraph (c) below when the Facility Agent executes an otherwise duly completed Transfer Certificate delivered to it by the Existing Lender and the New Lender. The Facility Agent shall,

# 28.5 Transfer Certificate

Subject to paragraph (b) below, as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt by it of a duly completed Transfer Certificate appearing on its face to comply with the terms of this agreement and delivered in accordance with the terms of this agreement, execute that Transfer Certificate.

(b) The Facility Agent shall only be obliged to execute a Transfer Certificate delivered to it by the Existing Lender and the New Lender once it is satisfied it has complied with all necessary "know your customer" or other similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations in relation to the transfer to such New Lender.

(c) Subject to clause 28.12 (Pro Rata Interest Settlement), on the Transfer Date:

1. To the extent that in the Transfer Certificate the Existing Lender seeks to transfer by novation its rights and obligations under the Senior Finance Documents, each of the Obligors and the Existing Lender shall be released from further obligations towards one another under the Senior Finance Documents and their respective rights against one another under the Senior Finance Documents shall be cancelled (being the "Discharged Rights and Obligations");
2. Each of the Obligors and the New Lender shall assume obligations towards one another and/or acquire rights against one another which differ from the Discharged Rights and Obligations only insofar as that Obligor or other Group Company and the New Lender have assumed and/or acquired the same in place of that Obligor and the Existing Lender;
3. The Facility Agent, the Arranger, the Security Agent, the New Lender, the other Lenders and any relevant Ancillary Lender shall acquire the same rights and assume the same obligations between themselves and in respect of the Transaction Security as they would have acquired and assumed had the New Lender been an Original Lender with the rights, and/or obligations acquired or assumed by it as a result of the transfer and to that extent the Facility Agent, the Arranger, the Security Agent and any relevant Ancillary Lender and the Existing Lender shall each be released from further obligations to each other under the Senior Finance Documents;
4. The New Lender shall become a Party as a "Lender".

# 28.6 Procedure for Assignment or Assignment and Assumption

(a) Subject to the conditions set out in clause 28.2 (Conditions of Assignment, Transfer or Sub-Participation) an assignment may be effected in accordance with paragraph (c) below when the Facility Agent executes an Assignment Agreement delivered to it and executed by the Existing Lender and the New Lender. The Facility Agent shall, subject to paragraph (b) below, as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt by it of a duly completed Assignment Agreement appearing on its face to comply with the terms of this agreement and delivered in accordance with the terms of this agreement, execute that Assignment Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, an Assignment Agreement will be treated as duly completed notwithstanding that the Parent may not have executed that Assignment Agreement to formally acknowledge the transfer of obligations.

(b) The Facility Agent shall only be obliged to execute an Assignment Agreement delivered to it by the Existing Lender and the New Lender once it is satisfied it has complied with all necessary "know your customer" or other similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations in relation to the assignment to such New Lender.

(c) Subject to clause 28.12 (Pro Rata Interest Settlement), on the Transfer Date:

1. the Existing Lender will assign absolutely to the New Lender its rights under the Senior Finance Documents and in respect of the Transaction Security expressed to be the subject of the assignment in the Assignment Agreement;
2. the Existing Lender will be released from the obligations (the "Relevant Obligations") expressed to be the subject of the release in the Assignment Agreement (and any corresponding obligations by which it is bound in respect of the Transaction Security); and
3. the New Lender shall become a Party as a "Lender" and will be bound by obligations equivalent to the Relevant Obligations.

(d) Lenders may utilise procedures other than those set out in this clause 28.6 to assign their rights under the Senior Finance Documents provided that they comply with the conditions set out in clause 28.2 (Conditions of Assignment, Transfer or Sub-Participation).

# 28.7 Copy of Transfer Certificate, Assignment Agreement or Increase Confirmation to Parent

The Facility Agent shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after it has executed a Transfer Certificate, an Assignment Agreement or an Increase Confirmation, send to the Parent a copy of that Transfer Certificate, Assignment Agreement or Increase Confirmation.

# 28.8 New CAR Facility Lender

1. Each CAR Facility Lender shall, by countersigning a CAR Facility Establishment Notice and delivering it to the Facility Agent be, deemed to be a party to this agreement as a Lender from the CAR Facility Date and:

1. each of the Obligors will owe obligations to the CAR Facility Lender in accordance with the terms of the Senior Finance Documents;
2. subject to any limits recorded in the Senior Finance Documents, the guarantees and security recorded in the Senior Finance Documents in favour of the Senior Finance Parties will extend to the CAR Facility Lender and the CAR Facility Loans; and
3. the Senior Finance Parties in each of their respective capacities shall acquire the rights and assume the obligations between themselves as if the CAR Facility Lender had been an original lender under this agreement in that capacity.

# 28.9 Accession of Hedge Counterparties

1. Any person which becomes a party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Hedge Counterparty shall at the same time, become a Party to this agreement as a Hedge Counterparty in accordance with clause 20.10 (Creditor Accession Undertaking) of the Intercreditor Agreement.
2. Where this agreement or any other Senior Finance Document imposes an obligation on a Hedge Counterparty and the relevant Hedge Counterparty is an Affiliate of a Lender and is not a party to that document, the relevant Lender shall ensure that the obligation is performed by its Affiliate.

# 28.10 Security over Lenders' Rights

In addition to the other rights provided to Lenders under this clause 28 (Changes to the Lenders), each Lender may without consulting with or obtaining consent from any Obligor, at any time charge, assign or otherwise create Security in or over (whether by way of collateral or otherwise) all or any of its rights under any Senior Finance Document to secure obligations of that Lender including, without limitation:

- (a) any charge, assignment or other Security to secure obligations to a federal reserve or central bank; and
- (b) in the case of any Lender which is a fund, any charge, assignment or other Security granted to any holders (or trustee or representatives of holders) of obligations owed, or securities issued, by that Lender as security for those obligations or securities,

except that no such charge, assignment or Security shall:

- (i) release a Lender from any of its obligations under the Senior Finance Documents or substitute the beneficiary of the relevant charge, assignment or Security for the Lender as a party to any of the Senior Finance Documents; or
- (ii) require any payments to be made by an Obligor or grant to any person any more extensive rights than those required to be made or granted to the relevant Lender under the Senior Finance Documents.

# 28.11 Continuation of Security

(a) Each Obligor consents to the assignments and transfers of rights and obligations permitted under and made in accordance with this clause 28 (Changes to the Lenders). Each Obligor agrees and confirms that its guarantee and indemnity obligations under the Senior Finance Documents and any Transaction Security granted by it in support of its own borrowing obligations or its guarantee or indemnity obligations under the Senior Finance Documents will continue notwithstanding any assignment or transfer under this clause 28 (Changes to the Lenders) and will extend to cover and support obligations owed to New Lenders and to continuing Senior Finance Parties.

(b) The Parent (for itself and as agent for the Obligors) will (at its own cost) as soon as reasonably practicable execute such documents and take such other actions as are necessary to effect or perfect an assignment or a transfer of rights and/or obligations to a New Lender under the Senior Finance Documents. Such action will include:

- (i) promptly countersigning Assignment Agreements (although any delay or failure by the Parent to so countersign an Assignment Agreement will not invalidate its operation); and
- (ii) subject to the Agreed Security Principles taking such steps as the Facility Agent or the Security Agent may request (including re-execution of Transaction Security Documents) for the purpose of ensuring that the New Lender has (and the other Senior Finance Parties continue to have) the benefit of the same security interests under the Transaction Security Documents as existed immediately before the relevant transfer.

# 28.12 Pro Rata Interest Settlement

If the Facility Agent has notified the Lenders that it is able to distribute interest payments on a "pro rata basis" to Existing Lenders and New Lenders then (in respect of any transfer pursuant to clause 28.5 (Procedure for Transfer) or any assignment pursuant to clause 28.6 (Procedure for Assignment or Assignment and Assumption) the Transfer Date of which, in each case, is after the date of such notification and is not on the last day of an Interest Period):

1. any interest or fees in respect of the relevant participation which are expressed to accrue by reference to the lapse of time shall continue to accrue in favour of the Existing Lender up to but excluding the Transfer Date ("Accrued Amounts") and shall become due and payable to the Existing Lender (without further interest accruing on them) on the last day of the current Interest Period (or, if the Interest Period is longer than six Months, on the next of the dates which falls at six-Monthly intervals after the first day of that Interest Period); and
2. the rights assigned or transferred by the Existing Lender will not include the right to the Accrued Amounts so that, for the avoidance of doubt:

1. when the Accrued Amounts become payable, those Accrued Amounts will be payable for the account of the Existing Lender; and
2. the amount payable to the New Lender on that date will be the amount which would, but for the application of this clause 28.12, have been payable to it on that date, but after deduction of the Accrued Amounts.
3. In this clause 28.12 references to "Interest Period" shall be construed to include a reference to any other period for accrual of fees.
