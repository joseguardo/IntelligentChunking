(a) Subject to paragraph (b) below, the financial covenants set out in clause 25.2 (Financial Condition) shall be calculated in accordance with the Accounting Principles and tested by reference to each of the financial statements delivered pursuant to paragraphs (a)(i) and (b) of clause 24.1 (Financial Statements) and/or each Compliance Certificate delivered pursuant to clause 24.2 (Provision and Contents of Compliance Certificate).

(b) If the Annual Financial Statements are not available when any covenant referred to in clause 25.2 (Financial Condition) is tested, but when those Annual Financial Statements become available, they show that the figures in any relevant Quarterly Financial Statements utilised for any such calculation cannot have been substantially accurate, the Facility Agent may require such adjustments to the calculations which it, in its discretion, acting reasonably and in good faith considers appropriate to rectify that inaccuracy and compliance with the covenants in clause 25.2 (Financial Condition) will be determined by reference to those adjusted figures.

(c) For each of the Relevant Periods ending on a date which is less than 12 months after the Closing Date the financial covenants in clauses 24.2(a) to (c) (Financial Condition) shall be calculated for the period from the Closing Date to the end of the Relevant Period except that when calculating EBITDA for the purpose of clause 25.2(c) (Leverage), clause 25.2(d) (Super Senior EBITDA) and paragraph (f) of the definition of Permitted Payment, EBITDA will be annualised.

# 25.4 Equity Cure

(a) If the Parent is in breach of any obligation set out in paragraphs (a) (Cashflow Cover), (b) (Interest Cover) or (c) (Leverage) of clause 25.2 (Financial Condition) (each a "Financial Covenant"), then the Parent may procure the contribution of New Shareholder Injections which, subject to the conditions in paragraphs (b) to (f) (inclusive) below, shall have the effect that each Financial Covenant is recalculated giving effect to the following adjustments:

(i) for the purpose of calculating Cashflow Cover, the amount of the New Shareholder Injection shall be added to the calculation of Cashflow in respect of Cashflow Cover for the Relevant Period in which the breach of Financial Covenant has occurred (the "Breach Period") and the three Relevant Periods immediately following;

(ii) for the purpose of calculating Leverage, the amount of the New Shareholder Injection shall be deducted from the calculation of Total Debt for the Breach Period;

(iii) for the purpose of calculating Interest Cover, the amount of the New Shareholder Injection shall be treated (for this purpose only) as having been applied in prepayment of the Facilities in accordance with clause 11.3(a) (Application of Mandatory Prepayments and Cancellations) on the first day of the Breach Period, and Finance Charges for the Breach Period and the three Relevant Periods immediately following shall be recalculated accordingly (without double counting any reduction in Finance Charges arising as a result of any cure amount being used in prepayment of the Facilities),

in each case making any further adjustment needed to ensure no double counting or accumulation of cure benefit, and compliance with clause 25.2 (Financial Condition) will be determined by reference to the relevant recalculation.

# 25.4 New Shareholder Injections

(b) Any New Shareholder Injection made to effect a cure of a Financial Covenant:

1. must be contributed in cash and received by the Parent no later than the date which is 15 Business Days following the date for delivery of the Compliance Certificate which relates to the Breach Period;
2. may exceed the amount required to rectify the breach of Financial Covenant (the "Overcure Amount");
3. 50 per cent of that New Shareholder Injection which is required to remedy the breach of a Financial Covenant must be applied in prepayment of the Facilities in the order set out in clause 11.3(a) (Application of Mandatory Prepayments and Cancellations) immediately if the New Shareholder Injection was made to cure a breach of a Financial Covenant set out in paragraphs (b) (Interest Cover) or (c) (Leverage) of clause 25.2 (Financial Condition). If applied to cure a breach of paragraph (a) (Cashflow), the New Shareholder Injection shall be retained by the Group and may be used for any purpose not prohibited by this agreement;
4. must be made on the basis that such New Shareholder Injection shall have no cash yield until after the Senior Discharge Date has occurred (as such term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement).

(c) The contribution of New Shareholder Injections may only be made for the purpose of effecting a cure of a Financial Covenant breach a maximum of three times and not in two successive Relevant Periods and not more than once in each 12 Month period.

(d) The Overcure Amount shall be applied as determined by the Parent either in or towards permanent prepayment of Term Loans under this agreement or retained by the Group for the general corporate and working capital purposes of the Group.

(e) Any recalculation made under this clause 25.4 will be solely for the purpose of curing a breach of clause 25.2 (Financial Condition) and not for any other purpose such as calculation of Margin or Excess Cashflow or for determining application of Excess Cashflow.

(f) If after Total Debt and Finance Charges are reduced and, as the case may be, Cashflow is increased in accordance with this clause 25.4, the financial covenants in clauses 25.4(a), (b), (c) or (d) are complied with, the Parent shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of those financial covenants as for the relevant testing date with the same effect as if there had been no breach of any of those financial covenants and that Default shall be deemed remedied for all purposes under the Finance Documents.
