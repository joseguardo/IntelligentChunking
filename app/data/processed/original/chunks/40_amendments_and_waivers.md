# 40. AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS

# 40.1 Intercreditor Agreement

This clause 40 is subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

# 40.2 Required Consents

(a) Subject to clauses 40.3 (All Lender Matters) to 40.7 (Excluded Commitments) (inclusive) and the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any term of the Senior Finance Documents may be amended or waived only with the consent of the Majority Lenders and the Parent and any such amendment or waiver will be binding on all Parties.

(b) The Facility Agent may effect, on behalf of any Senior Finance Party, any amendment or waiver permitted by this clause 40 (Amendments and Waivers).

(c) Without prejudice to the generality of paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) of clause 31.7 (Rights and Discretions), the Facility Agent may engage, pay for and rely on the services of lawyers in determining the consent level required for and effecting any amendment, waiver or consent under this agreement.

(d) Each Obligor agrees to any such amendment or waiver permitted by this clause 40 (Amendments and Waivers) which is agreed to by the Parent. This includes any amendment or waiver which would, but for this paragraph (d), require the consent of all of the Guarantors.

(e) If a decision of the Lenders is required, then each Lender which has Commitments in respect of which it is entitled to cast a vote or votes ("Eligible Commitments") may elect to vote all or only part of those Eligible Commitments and may also vote part of its Eligible Commitments in one way whilst voting another part of its Eligible Commitments in another way.

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, an amendment or waiver which requires the consent of all the Lenders requires 100 per cent of Eligible Commitments to be cast in favour and not merely all of the Lender institutions to vote in favour. The same principle applies mutatis mutandis to Majority Lender and Majority Revolving Facility Lender decision making.

# 40.3 All Lender Matters

An amendment, waiver or consent in relation to any term of any Senior Finance Document that has the effect of changing or which relates to:

- (a) the definition of "Hedge Counterparty", "Majority Lenders", "Majority Revolving Facility Lenders", "Material Company" and "Significant Disposal" in clause 1.1 (Definitions);
- (b) an extension to the date of payment of any amount under the Senior Finance Documents (other than in relation to clause 11 (Mandatory Prepayment and Cancellation));
- (c) a reduction in the Margin or a reduction in the amount of any payment of principal, interest, fees or commission payable under the Senior Finance Documents;
- (d) a change in the currency of payment of any amount under the Senior Finance Documents;
- (e) an increase in any Commitment or the Total Commitments, any extension of any Availability Period or any requirement that a cancellation of Commitments reduces the Commitments of the Lenders rateably under the relevant Facility;
- (f) a change to the Borrowers or Guarantors other than in accordance with clause 30 (Changes to the Obligors);
- (g) any provision which expressly requires the consent of all the Lenders;
- (h) the definition of "CAR Facility Maximum Amount" and/or Clause 3.4(a) (CAR Facility);
- (i) the definition of "CAR Facility Maximum Margin", Clauses 3.4(d) and/or Clauses 3.5 (CAR Facility) and 3.20 (Lender's right in relation to a CAR Facility);
- (j) clause 2.3 (Senior Finance Parties' Rights and Obligations), clause 11.3 (Application of Mandatory Prepayments and Cancellations), clause 12.10 (Application of Prepayments), clause 26.36 (Guarantors), clause 28 (Changes to the Lenders),

2. the Charged Property; or
3. the manner in which the proceeds of enforcement of the Transaction Security are distributed,

(m) the order of priority or subordination under the Intercreditor Agreement, shall not be made or given without the prior consent of all the Lenders.

# 40.4 Majority Revolving Facility Lender matters

An amendment, waiver or consent in relation to any term of any Senior Finance Document that has the effect of changing or which relates to:

1. a Material Event of Default, the definition of "Material Event of Default" or the definitions used therein;
2. the provisions of clause 24.1 (Financial statements) or clause 24.2 (Provision and Contents of Compliance Certificate) which has the effect of delaying the delivery of the financial statements or Compliance Certificate (as the case may be) referred to therein by more than 30 days (beyond the time limits contemplated by those provisions in their original form);
3. the definitions of "Permitted Security" or the provisions of clause 26.15 (Negative Pledge) to the extent that the effect of such amendment or waiver is to permit the incurrence of Security that ranks pari passu or in priority to the Revolving Facility and would be materially adverse to the interests of the Lenders under the Revolving Facility Lenders;
4. clause 27.6 (Insolvency), clause 27.7 (Insolvency Proceedings) or clause 27.8 (Creditors' Process) to the extent such change would be materially adverse to the interest of the Lenders under the Revolving Facility;

# 40.6 Other Exceptions

shall require the consent of the Majority Lenders and the Majority Revolving Lenders.

Any waiver of a Material Event of Default shall not require any consent of the Majority Lenders, provided that, where the event or circumstance that caused such Material Event of Default has also resulted in a Default, such Default may only be waived by the Majority Lenders, but for the avoidance of doubt any waiver of such Default by the Majority Lenders will not constitute a waiver of the corresponding Material Event of Default.

# 40.5 Approved List

(a) Subject to paragraph (b) below, the Approved List may be amended with the prior written consent of the Facility Agent (acting on the instruction of the Majority Lenders) and the Parent provided that the number of banks and financial institutions on the Approved List is not reduced at any time.

(b) The Parent may, subject to giving five Business Days prior notice to the Facility Agent, in its sole discretion:

- (i) add any new person to the Approved List at any time;

(g) The Facility Agent shall make available the Approved List for review by a Lender or a prospective New Lender at its request for the purposes of verifying of such Lender's compliance with the provisions of this agreement.

# 40.6 Other Exceptions

(a) An amendment or waiver which relates to the rights or obligations of the Facility Agent, the Arranger, the Security Agent, any Ancillary Lender or a Hedge Counterparty (each in their capacity as such) may not be effected without the consent of the Facility Agent, the Arranger, the Security Agent, that Ancillary Lender or as the case may be, that Hedge Counterparty.

(b) Any manifest error in the Senior Finance Documents which is of a typographical nature may be amended by agreement between the Facility Agent and the Parent and any such amendment will be binding on all Parties.

# 40.7 Excluded Commitments

If:

(a) any Defaulting Lender fails to respond to a request for a consent, waiver, amendment of or in relation to any term of any Senior Finance Document or any other vote of Lenders under the terms of this agreement within 20 Business Days of that request being made; or

(b) any Lender which is not a Defaulting Lender fails to respond to such a request (other than an amendment, waiver or consent referred to in paragraphs (b), (c) and (e) of clause 40.3 (All Lender Matters)) or such a vote within 20 Business Days of that request being made,

(unless, in either case, the Parent and the Facility Agent agree to a longer time period in relation to any request):

then any Lender who does not and continues not to consent or agree to such waiver or amendment shall be deemed a "Non-Consenting Lender".

# 40.9 Disenfranchisement of Defaulting Lenders

(a) For so long as a Defaulting Lender has any Available Commitment, in ascertaining:

1. the Majority Lenders; or
2. whether:
3.
any given percentage (including, for the avoidance of doubt, unanimity) of the Total Commitments under the relevant Facility/ies; or
4. the agreement of any specified group of Lenders,

has been obtained to approve any request for a consent, waiver, amendment or other vote of Lenders under the Senior Finance Documents, that Defaulting Lender's Commitments under the relevant Facility/ies will be reduced by the amount of its Available Commitments under the relevant Facility/ies and, to the extent that that reduction results in that Defaulting Lender's Total Commitments being zero, that Defaulting Lender shall be deemed not to be a Lender for the purposes of paragraphs (i) and (ii) above.

(b) For the purposes of this clause 40.9, the Facility Agent may assume that the following Lenders are Defaulting Lenders:

1. any Lender which has notified the Facility Agent that it has become a Defaulting Lender;

(ii) any Lender in relation to which it is aware that any of the events or circumstances referred to in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of the definition of "Defaulting Lender" has occurred, unless it has received notice to the contrary from the Lender concerned (together with any supporting evidence reasonably requested by the Facility Agent) or the Facility Agent is otherwise aware that the Lender has ceased to be a Defaulting Lender.
