# Form of Assignment Agreement

[This Assignment Agreement operates by way of ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION (as opposed to novation). Care needs to be taken to ensure this does not trigger stamp duties or other transfer taxes.]

[Execution and delivery of this Assignment Agreement may not of itself be sufficient to transfer the underlying security. Advice should be taken from lawyers in the jurisdictions where the security providers are incorporated.]

[Each of the existing lender and new lender should ensure that all regulatory requirements are satisfied in connection with this Assignment Agreement - including those necessary to remove the transferred assets from the regulatory balance sheet of the existing lender.]

The Existing Lender represents and warrants that:

[The New Lender confirms that the person beneficially entitled to interest payable to that Lender in respect of an advance under a Senior Finance Document is either:

- (a) a company resident in the United Kingdom for United Kingdom tax purposes; or
- (b) a partnership each member of which is:
- - (i) a company so resident in the United Kingdom; or
- (ii) a company not so resident in the United Kingdom which carries on a trade in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment and which brings into account in computing its chargeable profits (within the meaning of section 19 of the CTA) the whole of any share of interest payable in respect of that advance that falls to it by reason of Part 17 of the CTA; or

(c) a company not so resident in the United Kingdom which carries on a trade in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment and which brings into account interest payable in respect of that advance in computing the chargeable profits (within the meaning of section 19 of the CTA) of that company.]

13. We refer to clause [18.5] (Change of Senior Lender) of the Intercreditor Agreement. In consideration of the New Lender being accepted as a Senior Lender for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement (and as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), the New Lender confirms that, as from the Transfer Date, it intends to be party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Senior Lender, and undertakes to perform all the obligations expressed in the Intercreditor Agreement to be assumed by a Senior Lender and agrees that it shall be bound by all the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, as if it had been an original party to the Intercreditor Agreement.

14. This Agreement acts as notice to the Facility Agent (on behalf of each Senior Finance Party) and, upon delivery in accordance with clause 28.7 (Copy of Transfer Certificate, Assignment Agreement or Increase Confirmation to Parent) of the Facilities Agreement, to the Parent (on behalf of each Obligor) of the assignment referred to in this Agreement.

15. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and this has the same effect as if the signatures on the counterparts were on a single copy of this Agreement.

16. This Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it are governed by English law.

17. This Agreement has been entered into on the date stated at the beginning of this Agreement.

Note: The execution of this Assignment Agreement may not transfer a proportionate share of the Existing Lender's interest in the Transaction Security in all jurisdictions. It is the responsibility of the New Lender to ascertain whether any other documents or other formalities are required to perfect a transfer of such a share in the Existing Lender's Transaction Security in any jurisdiction and, if so, to arrange for execution of those documents and completion of those formalities.

Notes:

- * Delete as applicable. Each Lender is required to confirm which of these three categories it falls within.
- ** Include if the New Lender holds a passport under the HMRC DT Treaty Passport Scheme and wishes that scheme to apply to the Facilities Agreement.
