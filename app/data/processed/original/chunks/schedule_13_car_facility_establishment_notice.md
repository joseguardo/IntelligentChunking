# Lender Confirmations

We agree to become a party to the Facilities Agreement as a Lender with an CAR Commitment as recorded above.

We refer to clause 20.9 (New CAR Facility Lender) of the Intercreditor Agreement:

In consideration of being accepted as a CAR Facility Lender and therefore a Senior Lender for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement (and as defined therein), we hereby confirm that, as from the date of this notice, we intend to be party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Senior Lender, and undertake to perform all the obligations expressed in the Intercreditor Agreement to be assumed by a Senior Lender and agree that we shall be bound by all the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, as if we had been an original party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Senior Lender.

The CAR Facility Lender confirms, for the benefit of the Facility Agent and without liability to any Obligor, that it is:

- (a) [a Qualifying Lender (other than a Treaty Lender);]
- (b) [a Treaty Lender;]
- (c) [not a Qualifying Lender].3

[The CAR Facility Lender confirms that the person beneficially entitled to interest payable to that Lender in respect of an advance under a Senior Finance Document is either:

- (a) a company resident in the United Kingdom for United Kingdom tax purposes;
- (b) a partnership each member of which is:
- - (i) a company so resident in the United Kingdom; or
- (ii) a company not so resident in the United Kingdom which carries on a trade in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment and which brings into account in computing its chargeable profits (within the meaning of section 19 of the CTA) the whole of any share of interest payable in respect of that advance that falls to it by reason of Part 17 of the CTA; or

(c) a company not so resident in the United Kingdom which carries on a trade in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment and which brings into account

3 Delete as applicable - each CAR Facility Lender is required to confirm which of these three categories it falls within.

interest payable in respect of that advance in computing the chargeable profits (within the meaning of section 19 of the CTA) of that company.]4

[The CAR Facility Lender confirms that it holds a passport under the HMRC DT Treaty Passport scheme (reference number [•]) and is tax resident in [•],5 so that interest payable to it by borrowers is generally subject to full exemption from UK withholding tax, and requests that the Company notify:

- (a) each Borrower which is a Party as a Borrower as at the CAR Facility Establishment Date; and
- (b) each Additional Borrower which becomes an Additional Borrower after the CAR Facility Establishment Date,

that it wishes that scheme to apply to the Facilities Agreement.]6
