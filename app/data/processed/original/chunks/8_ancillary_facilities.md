(a) In this clause 8.6:

- (i) "Revolving Outstandings" means, in relation to a Lender, the aggregate of the equivalent in the Base Currency of:

(c) If an amount outstanding under an Ancillary Facility is a contingent liability and that contingent liability becomes an actual liability or is reduced to zero after the original adjustment is made under paragraph (b) above, then each Lender and Ancillary Lender will make a further adjustment (by making or receiving (as the case may be) corresponding transfers of rights and obligations under the Senior Finance Documents relating to Revolving Outstandings to the extent necessary) to put themselves in the position they would have been in had the original adjustment been determined by reference to the actual liability or, as the case may be, zero liability and not the contingent liability.

# 8.6 Transfer of Rights and Obligations

(d) Any transfer of rights and obligations relating to Revolving Outstandings made pursuant to this clause 8.6 shall be made for a purchase price in cash, payable at the time of transfer, in an amount equal to those Revolving Outstandings (less any accrued interest, fees and commission to which the transferor will remain entitled to receive notwithstanding that transfer, pursuant to clause 28.12 (Pro Rata Interest Settlement)).

(e) Prior to the application of the provisions of paragraph (b) above, an Ancillary Lender that has provided a Multi-account Overdraft shall set-off any Available Credit Balance on any account comprised in that Multi-account Overdraft.

(g) This clause 8.6 shall not oblige any Lender to accept the transfer of a claim relating to an amount outstanding under an Ancillary Facility which is not denominated (pursuant to the relevant Senior Finance Document) in either the Base Currency, a currency which has been an Optional Currency for the purpose of any Revolving Facility Utilisation or in another currency which is acceptable to that Lender.

# 8.7 Information

Each Borrower and each Ancillary Lender shall, promptly upon request by the Facility Agent, supply the Facility Agent with any information relating to the operation of an Ancillary Facility (including the Ancillary Outstandings) as the Facility Agent may reasonably request from time to time. Each Borrower consents to all such information being released to the Facility Agent and the other Senior Finance Parties.

# 8.8 Affiliates of Lenders as Ancillary Lenders

(a) Subject to the terms of this agreement, an Affiliate of a Lender may become an Ancillary Lender. In such case, the Lender and its Affiliate shall be treated as a single Lender whose Revolving Facility Commitment is the amount set out opposite the relevant Lender's name in part 2 or part 3 of schedule 1 (The Original Parties) and/or the amount of any Revolving Facility Commitment transferred to that Lender under this agreement, to the extent (in each case) not cancelled, reduced or transferred by it under this agreement.

(b) The Parent shall specify any relevant Affiliate of a Lender in any notice delivered by the Parent to the Facility Agent pursuant to clause 8.2(b)(i) (Availability).

(c) An Affiliate of a Lender which becomes an Ancillary Lender shall accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as an Ancillary Lender and any person which so accedes to the Intercreditor Agreement shall, at the same time, become a Party as an Ancillary Lender in accordance with clause 20.10 (Creditor Accession Undertaking) of the Intercreditor Agreement.

(d) If a Lender assigns all of its rights and benefits or transfers all of its rights and obligations to a New Lender, its Affiliate shall cease to have any obligations under this agreement or any Ancillary Document.

(d) Where this agreement or any other Senior Finance Document imposes an obligation on a Borrower under an Ancillary Facility and the relevant Borrower is an Affiliate of a Borrower which is not a party to that document, the relevant Borrower shall ensure that the obligation is performed by its Affiliate.

(e) Any reference in this agreement or any other Senior Finance Document to a Borrower being under no obligations (whether actual or contingent) as a Borrower under such Senior Finance Document shall be construed to include a reference to any Affiliate of a Borrower being under no obligations under any Senior Finance Document or Ancillary Document.

(f) If any Affiliate of a Borrower becomes a borrower of an Ancillary Facility, the relevant Borrower shall procure that such Affiliate accedes to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) no later than contemporaneously with the date on which it becomes a borrower.

Notwithstanding any other term of this agreement, each Lender shall ensure that at all times its Revolving Facility Commitment is not less than:

(a) its Ancillary Commitment; or

(b) the Ancillary Commitment of its Affiliate.

# 8.11 Amendments and Waivers - Ancillary Facilities

No amendment or waiver of a term of any Ancillary Facility shall require the consent of any Senior Finance Party other than the relevant Ancillary Lender unless such amendment or waiver itself relates to or gives rise to a matter which would require an amendment of or under this agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, under this clause 8 (Ancillary Facilities)). In such a case, clause 40 (Amendments and Waivers) will apply.
