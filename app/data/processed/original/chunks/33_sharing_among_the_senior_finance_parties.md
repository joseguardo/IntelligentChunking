# 33. SHARING AMONG THE SENIOR FINANCE PARTIES

# 33.1 Payments to Senior Finance Parties

(a) Subject to paragraph (b) below, if a Senior Finance Party (a "Recovering Senior Finance Party") receives or recovers any amount from an Obligor other than in accordance with clause 34 (Payment Mechanics) (a "Recovered Amount") and applies that amount to a payment due under the Senior Finance Documents then:

- (i) the Recovering Senior Finance Party shall, within three Business Days, notify details of the receipt or recovery, to the Facility Agent;
- (ii) the Facility Agent shall determine whether the receipt or recovery is in excess of the amount the Recovering Senior Finance Party would have been paid had the receipt or recovery been received or made by the Facility Agent and distributed in accordance with clause 34 (Payment Mechanics), without taking account of any Tax which would be imposed on the Facility Agent in relation to the receipt, recovery or distribution; and
- (iii) the Recovering Senior Finance Party shall, within three Business Days of demand by the Facility Agent, pay to the Facility Agent an amount (the "Sharing Payment") equal to such receipt or recovery less any amount which the Facility Agent determines may be retained by the Recovering Senior Finance Party as its share of any payment to be made, in accordance with clause 34.6 (Partial Payments).

(b) Paragraph (a) above shall not apply to any amount received or recovered by an Ancillary Lender in respect of any cash cover provided for the benefit of that Ancillary Lender.

# 33.2 Redistribution of Payments

The Facility Agent shall treat the Sharing Payment as if it had been paid by the relevant Obligor and distribute it between the Senior Finance Parties (other than the Recovering Senior Finance Party) (the "Sharing Senior Finance Parties") in accordance with clause 34.6 (Partial Payments) towards the obligations of that Obligor to the Sharing Finance Parties.

# 33.3 Recovering Senior Finance Party's Rights

On a distribution by the Facility Agent under clause 33.2 (Redistribution of Payments), of a payment received by a Recovering Senior Finance Party from an Obligor, as between the relevant Obligor and the Recovering Senior Finance Party, an amount of the Recovered Amount equal to the Sharing Payment will be treated as not having been paid by that Obligor.

# 33.4 Reversal of Redistribution

If any part of the Sharing Payment received or recovered by a Recovering Senior Finance Party becomes repayable and is repaid by that Recovering Senior Finance Party, then:

- (a) each Sharing Senior Finance Party shall, upon request of the Facility Agent, pay to the Facility Agent for the account of that Recovering Senior Finance Party an

amount equal to the appropriate part of its share of the Sharing Payment (together with an amount as is necessary to reimburse that Recovering Senior Finance Party for its proportion of any interest on the Sharing Payment which that Recovering Senior Finance Party is required to pay) (the "Redistributed Amount"); and

(b) as between the relevant Obligor and each relevant Sharing Senior Finance Party, an amount equal to the relevant Redistributed Amount will be treated as not having been paid by that Obligor.

# 33.5 Exceptions

(a) This clause 33 (Sharing Among the Senior Finance Parties) shall not apply to the extent that the Recovering Senior Finance Party would not, after making any payment pursuant to this clause, have a valid and enforceable claim against the relevant Obligor.

(b) A Recovering Senior Finance Party is not obliged to share with any other Senior Finance Party any amount which the Recovering Senior Finance Party has received or recovered as a result of taking legal or arbitration proceedings, if:

(i) it notified the other Senior Finance Party of the legal or arbitration proceedings; and

(ii) the other Senior Finance Party had an opportunity to participate in those legal or arbitration proceedings but did not do so as soon as reasonably practicable having received notice and did not take separate legal or arbitration proceedings.

# 33.6 Ancillary Lenders

(a) This clause 33 (Sharing Among the Senior Finance Parties) shall not apply to any receipt or recovery by a Lender in its capacity as an Ancillary Lender at any time prior to service of notice under either clause 27.19 (Acceleration) or clause 27.20 (Revolving Facility Acceleration).

(b) Following service of notice under either clause 27.19 (Acceleration) or clause 27.20 (Revolving Facility Acceleration), this clause 33 (Sharing Among the Senior Finance Parties) shall apply to all receipts or recoveries by Ancillary Lenders except to the extent that the receipt or recovery represents a reduction of the Gross Outstandings of a Multi-account Overdraft to or towards an amount equal to its Net Outstandings.
