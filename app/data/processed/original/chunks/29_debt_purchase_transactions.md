1. Subject to paragraph (b) below, the Parent shall not, and shall procure that each other Group Company shall not:

1. enter into any Debt Purchase Transaction other than in accordance with the other provisions of this clause 29; or
2. beneficially own all or any part of the share capital of a company that is a Lender or a party to a Debt Purchase Transaction of the type referred to in paragraphs (b) or (c) of the definition of "Debt Purchase Transaction".
2. A Borrower may purchase by way of assignment, pursuant to clause 28 (Changes to the Lenders), a participation in any Term Loan or after the end of its Availability Period, any CAR Facility Loan in respect of which it is the borrower and any related Commitment where:

1. that purchase is made for a consideration of less than par;
2. that purchase is made using one of the processes set out at paragraphs (c) and (d) below;
3. that purchase is made at a time when no Default is continuing; and
4. the consideration for that purchase is funded from (1) Retained Excess Cashflow for the Financial Year of the Parent immediately preceding the

Financial Year of the Parent in which such purchase is to be made or (2) New Shareholder Injections.

(c) A Debt Purchase Transaction referred to in paragraph (b) above may be entered into pursuant to a solicitation process (a "Solicitation Process") which is carried out as follows:

(i) prior to 11.00 a.m. on a given Business Day (the "Solicitation Day") the Parent or a financial institution acting on its behalf (the "Purchase Agent") will approach at the same time each Lender which participates in the relevant Term Facility or the CAR Facility to enable them to offer to sell to the relevant Borrower(s) an amount of their participation in one or more Term Facility or the CAR Facility. Any Lender wishing to make such an offer shall, by 11.00 a.m. on the second Business Day following that Solicitation Day, communicate to the Purchase Agent details of the amount of its participations, and in which Term Facility or CAR Facility, it is offering to sell and the price at which it is offering to sell such participations. Any such offer shall be irrevocable until 11.00 a.m. on the third Business Day following that Solicitation Day and shall be capable of acceptance by the Parent on behalf of the relevant Borrower(s) on or before such time by communicating its acceptance in writing to the Purchase Agent or, if it is the Purchase Agent, the relevant Lenders. The Purchase Agent (if someone other than the Parent) will communicate to the relevant Lenders which offers have been accepted by 12 noon on the third Business day following that Solicitation Day. In any event by 5.00 p.m. on the fourth Business Day following that Solicitation Day, the Parent shall notify the Facility Agent of the amounts of the participations purchased through the relevant Solicitation Process, the identity of the Term Facility or the CAR Facility to which they relate and the average price paid for the purchase of participations in each relevant Term Facility or CAR Facility. The Facility Agent shall promptly disclose such information to the Lenders;

(ii) any purchase of participations in the Term Facility or CAR Facility pursuant to a Solicitation Process shall be completed and settled on or before the fifth Business Day after the relevant Solicitation Day; and

(iii) in accepting any offers made pursuant to a Solicitation Process the Parent shall be free to select which offers and in which amounts it accepts but on the basis that in relation to a participation in a particular Term Facility it accepts offers in inverse order of the price offered (with the offer or offers at the lowest price being accepted first) and that if in respect of participations in a particular Term Facility it receives two or more offers at the same price it shall only accept such offers on a pro rata basis.

(d) A Debt Purchase Transaction referred to in paragraph (b) above may also be entered into pursuant to an open order process (an "Open Order Process") which is carried out as follows:

(i) the Parent (on behalf of the relevant Borrower(s)) may by itself or through another Purchase Agent place an open order (an "Open Order") to purchase participations in one or more of the Term Facility or the CAR Facility up to a set aggregate amount at a set price by notifying at the same time all the Lenders participating in the relevant Term Facility or CAR Facility of the same. Any Lender wishing to sell pursuant to an Open Order will, by 11.00 a.m. on any Business Day following the date on which the Open Order is placed but no earlier than the first Business Day, and no later than the fifth Business Day, following the date on which the Open Order is placed, communicate to the Purchase Agent details of the amount of its

participations, and in which Term Facility or CAR Facility, it is offering to sell. Any such offer to sell shall be irrevocable until 11.00 a.m. on the Business Day following the date of such offer from the Lender and shall be capable of acceptance by the Parent on behalf of the relevant Borrower(s) on or before such time by it communicating such acceptance in writing to the relevant Lender;

1. any purchase of participations in the Term Facility or CAR Facility pursuant to an Open Order Process shall be completed and settled by the relevant Borrower(s) on or before the fourth Business Day after the date of the relevant offer by a Lender to sell under the relevant Open Order;
2. if in respect of participations in a Term Facility or CAR Facility the Purchase Agent receives on the same Business Day two or more offers at the set price such that the maximum amount of such Term Facility or CAR Facility to which an Open Order relates would be exceeded, the Parent shall only accept such offers on a pro rata basis;
3. the Parent shall, by 5.00 p.m. on the sixth Business Day following the date on which an Open Order is placed, notify the Facility Agent of the amounts of the participations purchased through such Open Order Process and the identity of the Term Facility or CAR Facility to which they relate. The Facility Agent shall promptly disclose such information to the Lenders.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, there is no limit on the number of occasions a Solicitation Process or an Open Order Process may be implemented.

(f) In relation to any Debt Purchase Transaction entered into pursuant to this clause 29 (Debt Purchase Transactions), notwithstanding any other term of this agreement or the other Senior Finance Documents:

1. on completion of the relevant assignment pursuant to clause 28 (Changes to the Lenders), the portions of the Term Loans or CAR Facility Loan to which it relates shall be extinguished;
2. that Debt Purchase Transaction and the related extinguishment referred to in paragraph (i) above shall not constitute a prepayment of the Facilities;
3. the Borrower which is the assignee shall be deemed to be an entity which fulfils the requirements of clause 28.1 (Assignments and Transfers by the Lenders) to be a New Lender;
4. no Group Company shall be deemed to be in breach of any provision of clause 26 (General Undertakings) solely by reason of that Debt Purchase Transaction;
5. clause 33 (Sharing among the Senior Finance Parties) shall not be applicable to the consideration paid under such Debt Purchase Transaction;
6. for the avoidance of doubt, any extinguishment of any part of the Term Loans or CAR Facility Loan shall not affect any amendment or waiver which prior to that extinguishment had been approved by or on behalf of the requisite Lender or Lenders in accordance with this agreement.

# 29.2 Disenfranchisement on Debt Purchase Transactions entered into by Sponsor Affiliates

(a) For so long as a Sponsor Affiliate:

- (i) beneficially owns a Commitment; or
- (ii) has entered into a sub-participation agreement relating to a Commitment or other agreement or arrangement having a substantially similar economic effect and such agreement or arrangement has not been terminated;

in ascertaining:

- (A) the Majority Lenders or the Majority Revolving Facility Lenders; or
- (B) whether:

has been obtained to approve any request for a consent, waiver, amendment or other vote under the Senior Finance Documents such Commitment shall be deemed to be zero and such Sponsor Affiliate or the person with whom it has entered into such sub-participation, other agreement or arrangement shall be deemed not to be a Lender for the purposes of paragraphs (A) and (B) above (unless in the case of a person not being a Sponsor Affiliate it is a Lender by virtue otherwise than by beneficially owning the relevant Commitment).

(b) Each Lender shall, unless such Debt Purchase Transaction is an assignment or transfer, promptly notify the Facility Agent in writing if it knowingly enters into a Debt Purchase Transaction with a Sponsor Affiliate, (a "Notifiable Debt Purchase Transaction"), such notification to be substantially in the form set out in part 1 of schedule 11 (Forms of Notifiable Debt Purchase Transaction Notice).

(c) A Lender shall promptly notify the Facility Agent if a Notifiable Debt Purchase Transaction to which it is a party:

- (i) is terminated; or
- (ii) ceases to be with a Sponsor Affiliate,

such notification to be substantially in the form set out in part 2 of schedule 11 (Forms of Notifiable Debt Purchase Transaction Notice).

(d) Each Sponsor Affiliate that is a Lender agrees that:

- (i) in relation to any meeting or conference call to which all the Lenders are invited to attend or participate, it shall not attend or participate in the same if so requested by the Facility Agent or, unless the Facility Agent otherwise agrees, be entitled to receive the agenda or any minutes of the same; and
- (ii) in its capacity as Lender, unless the Facility Agent otherwise agrees, it shall not be entitled to receive any report or other document prepared at the behest of, or on the instructions of, the Facility Agent or one or more of the Lenders.

29.3 Sponsor Affiliates' notification to other Lenders of Debt Purchase Transactions

Any Sponsor Affiliate which is or becomes a Lender and which enters into a Debt Purchase Transaction as a purchaser or a participant shall, by 5.00 p.m. on the Business Day following the day on which it entered into that Debt Purchase Transaction, notify the Facility Agent of the extent of the Commitment(s) or amount outstanding to which that Debt Purchase Transaction relates. The Facility Agent shall promptly disclose such information to the Lenders.
