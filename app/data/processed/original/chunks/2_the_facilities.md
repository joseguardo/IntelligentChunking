request that the Commitments relating to any Facility be increased (and the Commitments relating to that Facility shall be so increased) in an aggregate amount in the Base Currency of up to the amount of the Available Commitments or Commitments relating to that Facility so cancelled as follows:

(iii) the increased Commitments will be assumed by one or more Lenders or other banks, financial institutions, trusts, funds or other entities (each an "Increase Lender") selected by the Parent (each of which shall not be a Sponsor Affiliate or a Group Company) and each of which confirms in writing (whether in the relevant Increase Confirmation or otherwise) its willingness to assume and does assume all the obligations of a Lender corresponding to that part of the increased Commitments which it is to assume, as if it had been an Original Lender;

(iv) each of the Obligors and any Increase Lender shall assume obligations towards one another and/or acquire rights against one another as the Obligors and the Increase Lender would have assumed and/or acquired had the Increase Lender been an Original Lender;

(v) each Increase Lender shall become a Party as a "Lender" and any Increase Lender and each of the other Senior Finance Parties shall assume obligations towards one another and acquire rights against one another as that Increase Lender and those Senior Finance Parties would have assumed and/or acquired had the Increase Lender been an Original Lender;

(vii) any increase in the Commitments relating to a Facility shall take effect on the date specified by the Parent in the notice referred to above or any later date on which the conditions set out in paragraph (b) below are satisfied.

(b) An increase in the Commitments relating to a Facility will only be effective on:

(i) the execution by the Facility Agent of an Increase Confirmation from the relevant Increase Lender;

(ii) in relation to an Increase Lender which is not a Lender immediately prior to the relevant increase:

The Facility Agent shall promptly notify the Parent and the Increase Lender upon being so satisfied.

(c) Each Increase Lender, by executing the Increase Confirmation, confirms (for the avoidance of doubt) that the Facility Agent has authority to execute on its behalf any amendment or waiver that has been approved by or on behalf of the requisite Lender or Lenders in accordance with this agreement on or prior to the date on which the increase becomes effective.

(d) The Parent shall within 3 Business Days of demand pay the Facility Agent and the Security Agent the amount of all costs and expenses (including legal fees subject to any agreed cap) reasonably and properly incurred by either of them and, in the case of the Security Agent, by any Receiver or Delegate in connection with any increase in Commitments under this clause 2.2.

(e) The Increase Lender shall, on the date upon which the increase takes effect, pay to the Facility Agent (for its own account) a fee in an amount equal to the fee which

# 2.2 Increase Lenders

would be payable under clause 28.3 (Assignment or Transfer Fee) if the increase was a transfer pursuant to clause 28.5 (Procedure for Transfer) and if the Increase Lender was a New Lender.

(f) Clause 28.4 (Limitation of Responsibility of Existing Lenders) shall apply mutatis mutandis in this clause 2.2 in relation to an Increase Lender as if references in that clause to:

# 2.3 Senior Finance Parties Rights and Obligations

(a) The obligations of each Senior Finance Party under the Senior Finance Documents are several. Failure by a Senior Finance Party to perform its obligations under the Senior Finance Documents does not affect the obligations of any other Party under the Senior Finance Documents. No Senior Finance Party is responsible for the obligations of any other Senior Finance Party under the Senior Finance Documents.

(b) The rights of each Senior Finance Party under or in connection with the Senior Finance Documents are separate and independent rights and any debt arising under the Senior Finance Documents to a Senior Finance Party from an Obligor shall be a separate and independent debt.

(c) A Senior Finance Party may, except as otherwise stated in the Senior Finance Documents, separately enforce its rights under the Senior Finance Documents.

# 2.4 Obligors' Agent

(a) Each Obligor (other than the Parent) by its execution of this agreement or an Accession Deed irrevocably appoints the Parent (acting through one or more authorised signatories) to act on its behalf as its agent in relation to the Senior Finance Documents and irrevocably authorises:

- (i) the Parent on its behalf to supply all information concerning itself contemplated by this agreement to the Senior Finance Parties and to give all notices and instructions (including, in the case of a Borrower, Utilisation Requests), to execute on its behalf any Accession Deed, to make such agreements and to effect the relevant amendments, supplements and variations (in each case, however fundamental) capable of being given, made or effected by any Obligor (notwithstanding that they may increase the Obligor's obligations including increasing interest and fees payable, amounts borrowed, guaranteed or incurred or the terms relating to them or otherwise affect the Obligor) and to give confirmation as to continuation of surety obligations, without further reference to or the consent of that Obligor; and
- (ii) each Senior Finance Party to give any notice, demand or other communication to that Obligor pursuant to the Senior Finance Documents to the Parent,

and in each case the Obligor shall be bound as though the Obligor itself had given the notices and instructions (including, without limitation, any Utilisation Requests).

or executed or made the agreements or effected the amendments, supplements or variations, or received the relevant notice, demand or other communication.

(b) Every act, omission, agreement, undertaking, settlement, waiver, amendment, supplement, variation, notice or other communication given or made by the Obligors' Agent or given to the Obligors' Agent under any Senior Finance Document on behalf of another Obligor or in connection with any Senior Finance Document (whether or not known to any other Obligor and whether occurring before or after such other Obligor became an Obligor under any Senior Finance Document) shall be binding for all purposes on that Obligor as if that Obligor had expressly made, given or concurred with it. In the event of any conflict between any notices or other communications of the Obligors' Agent and any other Obligor, those of the Obligors' Agent shall prevail.
