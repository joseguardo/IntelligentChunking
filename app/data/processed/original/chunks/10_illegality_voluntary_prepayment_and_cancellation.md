# 10. ILLEGALITY, VOLUNTARY PREPAYMENT AND CANCELLATION

# 10.1 Illegality

If it becomes unlawful in any applicable jurisdiction for a Lender to perform any of its obligations as contemplated by this agreement or to fund, issue or maintain its participation in any Utilisation or it becomes unlawful for any Affiliate of a Lender for that Lender to do so:

(a) that Lender shall promptly notify the Facility Agent upon becoming aware of that event;

(b) upon the Facility Agent notifying the Parent, each Available Commitment of that Lender will be immediately cancelled; and

(c) to the extent that the Lender's participation has not been transferred pursuant to clause 40.8 (Replacement of Lender), each Borrower shall repay that Lender's participation in the Utilisations made to that Borrower on the last day of the

Interest Period for each Utilisation occurring after the Facility Agent has notified the Parent or, if earlier, the date specified by the Lender in the notice delivered to the Facility Agent (being no earlier than the last day of any applicable grace period permitted by law) and that Lender's corresponding Commitment(s) shall be cancelled in the amount of the participations repaid.

# 10.2 Voluntary Cancellation

The Parent may, if it gives the Facility Agent not less than five Business Days' (or such shorter period as the Majority Lenders may agree) prior notice, cancel the whole or any part (being a minimum amount of £100,000) of an Available Facility. Any cancellation under this clause 10.2 shall reduce the Commitments of the Lenders rateably under that Facility.

# 10.3 Voluntary Prepayment of Term Loans and CAR Facility Loans

(a) Subject to (c) below, a Borrower to which a Term Loan has been made or (after the end of its Availability Period) a CAR Facility Loan has been made may, if it or the Parent gives the Facility Agent not less than five Business Days' (or such shorter period as the Majority Lenders under the relevant Facility may agree) prior notice, prepay the whole or any part of that Term Loan or CAR Facility Loan (but, if in part, being an amount that reduces the Base Currency Amount of that Term Loan or CAR Facility Loan by a minimum amount of £250,000).

(b) A Term Loan or CAR Facility Loan may only be prepaid after the last day of the Availability Period for the applicable Facility (or, if earlier, the day on which the applicable Available Facility is zero).

(c) A Term Loan or CAR Facility Loan may not be prepaid at any time when a Revolving Facility Standstill Period is continuing.

# 10.4 Voluntary Prepayment of Revolving Facility Utilisations

A Borrower to which a Revolving Facility Utilisation has been made may, if it or the Parent gives the Facility Agent not less than 5 Business Days' (or such shorter period as the Majority Lenders may agree) prior notice, prepay the whole or any part of a Revolving Facility Utilisation (but if in part, being an amount that reduces the Base Currency Amount of the Revolving Facility Utilisation by a minimum amount of £100,000).

# 10.5 Right of Cancellation and Repayment in Relation to a Single Lender

(a) If:

- (i) any sum payable to any Lender by an Obligor is required to be increased under clause 17.2(c) (Tax Gross-up); or
- (ii) any Lender claims indemnification from the Parent or an Obligor under clause 17.3 (Tax Indemnity) or clause 18.1 (Increased Costs),

the Parent may, whilst the circumstance giving rise to the requirement for that increase or indemnification continues, give the Facility Agent notice (if such circumstances relate to a Lender) of cancellation of the Commitment of that Lender and its intention to procure the repayment of that Lender's participation in the Utilisations; or may, if such circumstances relate to a Lender, instead exercise its rights under clause 40.8 (Replacement of Lender).

(b) On receipt of a notice referred to in paragraph (a) above in relation to a Lender, the Commitment(s) of that Lender shall immediately be reduced to zero.

(c) On the last day of each Interest Period which ends after the Parent has given notice under paragraph (a) above in relation to a Lender (or, if earlier, the date specified by the Parent in that notice), each Borrower to which a Utilisation is outstanding shall repay that Lender's participation in that Utilisation together with all interest and other amounts accrued under the Senior Finance Documents.

# 10.6 Right of Cancellation in Relation to a Defaulting Lender

(a) If any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, the Parent may, at any time whilst the Lender continues to be a Defaulting Lender, give the Facility Agent 5 Business Days' notice of cancellation of each Available Commitment of that Lender.

(b) On the notice referred to in paragraph (a) above becoming effective, each Available Commitment of the Defaulting Lender shall immediately be reduced to zero.

(c) The Facility Agent shall as soon as practicable after receipt of a notice referred to in paragraph (a) above, notify all the Lenders.
