# 22. GUARANTEE AND INDEMNITY

# 22.1 Guarantee and Indemnity

Each Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally jointly and severally:

- (a) guarantees to each Senior Finance Party punctual performance by each other Obligor of all that Obligor's obligations under the Senior Finance Documents;
- (b) undertakes with each Senior Finance Party that whenever another Obligor does not pay any amount when due under or in connection with any Senior Finance Document, that Guarantor shall immediately on demand pay that amount as if it was the principal obligor; and
- (c) agrees with each Senior Finance Party that if any obligation guaranteed by it is or becomes unenforceable, invalid or illegal, it will, as an independent and primary obligation, indemnify that Senior Finance Party immediately on demand against any cost, loss or liability it incurs as a result of an Obligor not paying any amount which would, but for such unenforceability, invalidity or illegality, have been payable by it under any Senior Finance Document on the date when it would have been due. The amount payable by a Guarantor under this indemnity will not exceed the amount it would have had to pay under this clause 22 (Guarantee and Indemnity) if the amount claimed had been recoverable on the basis of a guarantee.

# 22.2 Continuing Guarantee

This guarantee is a continuing guarantee and will extend to the ultimate balance of sums payable by any Obligor under the Senior Finance Documents, regardless of any intermediate payment or discharge in whole or in part.

# 22.3 Reinstatement

If any discharge, release arrangement (whether in respect of the obligations of any Obligor or any security for those obligations or otherwise) is made by a Finance Party in

whole or in part on the basis of any payment, security or other disposition which is avoided or must be restored in insolvency, liquidation, administration or otherwise, without limitation, then the liability of each Guarantor under this clause will continue or be reinstated as if the discharge, release or arrangement had not occurred.

# 22.4 Waiver of Defences

The obligations of each Guarantor under this clause 22 (Guarantee and Indemnity) will not be affected by an act, omission, matter or thing which, but for this clause 22 (Guarantee and Indemnity), would reduce, release or prejudice any of its obligations under this clause 22 (Guarantee and Indemnity) (without limitation and whether or not known to it or any Senior Finance Party) including:

- (a) any time, waiver or consent granted to, or composition with, any Obligor or other person;
- (b) the release of any other Obligor or any other person under the terms of any composition or arrangement with any creditor of any Group Company;
- (c) the taking, variation, compromise, exchange, renewal or release of, or refusal or neglect to perfect, take up or enforce, any rights against, or Security over assets of, any Obligor or other person or any non-presentation or non-observance of any formality or other requirement in respect of any instrument or any failure to realise the full value of any Security;
- (d) any incapacity or lack of power, authority or legal personality of or dissolution or change in the members or status of an Obligor or any other person;
- (e) any amendment, novation, supplement, extension restatement (however fundamental and whether or not more onerous) or replacement of a Senior Finance Document or any other document or security including, without limitation, any change in the purpose of, any extension of or increase in any facility or the addition of any new facility under any Senior Finance Document or other document or security;
- (f) any unenforceability, illegality or invalidity of any obligation of any person under any Senior Finance Document or any other document or Security; or
- (g) any insolvency or similar proceedings.

# 22.5 Guarantor Intent

Without prejudice to the generality of clause 22.4 (Waiver of Defences), each Guarantor expressly confirms that it intends that this guarantee shall extend from time to time to any (however fundamental) variation, increase, extension or addition of or to any of the Senior Finance Documents and/or any facility or amount made available under any of the Senior Finance Documents for the purposes of or in connection with any of the following: acquisitions of any nature; increasing working capital; enabling investor or management distributions to be made; carrying out restructurings; refinancing existing facilities; refinancing any other indebtedness; making facilities available to new borrowers; any other variation or extension of the purposes for which any such facility or amount might be made available from time to time; and any fees, costs and/or expenses associated with any of the foregoing.

# 22.6 Immediate Recourse

Each Guarantor waives any right it may have of first requiring any Senior Finance Party (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) to proceed against or enforce any other rights or security or claim payment from any person before claiming from that Guarantor under this

# 22. Guarantee and Indemnity

This waiver applies irrespective of any law or any provision of a Senior Finance Document to the contrary.

# 22.7 Appropriations

Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Obligors under or in connection with the Senior Finance Documents have been irrevocably paid in full, each Senior Finance Party (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) may:

- (a) refrain from applying or enforcing any other moneys, Security or rights held or received by that Senior Finance Party (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) in respect of those amounts, or apply and enforce the same in such manner and order as it sees fit (whether against those amounts or otherwise) and no Guarantor shall be entitled to the benefit of the same; and
- (b) hold in an interest-bearing suspense account any moneys received from any Guarantor or on account of any Guarantor's liability under this clause 22 (Guarantee and Indemnity).

# 22.8 Deferral of Guarantors' Rights

Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Obligors under or in connection with the Senior Finance Documents have been irrevocably paid in full and unless the Facility Agent otherwise directs, no Guarantor will exercise any rights which it may have by reason of performance by it of its obligations under the Senior Finance Documents or by reason of any amounts being payable, or liability arising under this clause 22 (Guarantee and Indemnity):

- (a) to be indemnified by an Obligor;
- (b) to claim any contribution from any other guarantor of any Obligor's obligations under the Senior Finance Documents;
- (c) to take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of any rights of the Senior Finance Parties under the Senior Finance Documents or of any other guarantee or security taken pursuant to, or in connection with, the Senior Finance Documents by any Senior Finance Party;
- (d) to bring legal or other proceedings for an order requiring any Obligor to make any payment, or perform any obligation, in respect of which any Guarantor has given a guarantee, undertaking or indemnity under clause 22.1 (Guarantee and Indemnity);
- (e) to exercise any right of set-off against any Obligor; and/or
- (f) to claim or prove as a creditor of any Obligor in competition with any Senior Finance Party.

If a Guarantor receives any benefit, payment or distribution in relation to such rights it shall hold that benefit, payment or distribution (to the extent necessary to enable all amounts which may be or become payable to the Senior Finance Parties by the Obligors under or in connection with the Senior Finance Documents to be repaid in full) on trust for the Senior Finance Parties and shall promptly pay or transfer the same to the Facility Agent or as the Facility Agent may direct for application in accordance with clause 34 (Payment Mechanics).

# 22.9 Release of Guarantors' Right of Contribution

If any Guarantor (a "Retiring Guarantor") ceases to be a Guarantor in accordance with the terms of the Senior Finance Documents for the purpose of any sale or other disposal of that Retiring Guarantor then on the date such Retiring Guarantor ceases to be a Guarantor:

- (a) that Retiring Guarantor is released by each other Guarantor from any liability (whether past, present or future and whether actual or contingent) to make a contribution to any other Guarantor arising by reason of the performance by any other Guarantor of its obligations under the Senior Finance Documents; and
- (b) each other Guarantor waives any rights it may have by reason of the performance of its obligations under the Senior Finance Documents to take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of any rights of the Senior Finance Parties under any Senior Finance Document or of any other security taken pursuant to, or in connection with, any Senior Finance Document where such rights or security are granted by or in relation to the assets of the Retiring Guarantor.

# 22.10 Additional Security

This guarantee is in addition to and is not in any way prejudiced by any other guarantee or security now or subsequently held by any Senior Finance Party.

# 22.11 Guarantee Limitations

- (a) Guarantee Obligations

For the purpose of this clause 22.11 "Guarantee Obligations" means the obligations and liabilities of the relevant Obligor under clause 22.1 (Guarantee and Indemnity) and under any other guarantee or indemnity provision in a Senior Finance Document.
- (b) Unlawful Financial Assistance

Without limiting any specific exemptions set out below:

- (i) no Obligor's Guarantee Obligations will extend to include any obligation or liability; and
- (ii) no Security granted by an Obligor will secure any Guarantee Obligation, if to do so would be unlawful financial assistance in respect of the acquisition of shares in itself or its Holding Company or any equivalent and applicable provisions under the laws of the Original Jurisdiction of the relevant Obligor.
- (c) Severance of Obligations

If, notwithstanding paragraph (b) above, the Guarantee Obligations or Transaction Security would be unlawful financial assistance, then, to the extent necessary to give effect to paragraph (b) above, the obligations under the Senior Finance Documents will be deemed to have been split into two tranches; "Tranche 1" comprising those obligations which may be secured by the Guarantee Obligations or Transaction Security without breaching relevant financial assistance laws and "Tranche 2" comprising the remainder of the obligations under the Senior Finance Documents. The Tranche 2 obligations will be excluded from the Guarantee Obligations and will be allocated to the Facilities to which those obligations relate, to the extent that that can be determined. To the extent that the relevant Facility
