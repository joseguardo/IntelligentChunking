# 7. OPTIONAL CURRENCIES

# 7.1 Selection of Currency

A Borrower (or the Parent on behalf of a Borrower) shall select the currency of a Revolving Facility Utilisation in a Utilisation Request.

# 7.2 Unavailability of a Currency

If before the Specified Time on any Quotation Day:

- (a) a Lender notifies the Facility Agent that the Optional Currency requested is not readily available to it in the amount required; or
- (b) a Lender notifies the Facility Agent that compliance with its obligation to participate in a Loan in the proposed Optional Currency would contravene a law or regulation applicable to it,

the Facility Agent will give notice to the relevant Borrower or Parent to that effect by the Specified Time on that day. In this event, any Lender that gives notice pursuant to this clause 7.2 will be required to participate in the Loan in the Base Currency (in an amount equal to that Lender's proportion of the Base Currency Amount, or in respect of a Rollover Loan, an amount equal to that Lender's proportion of the Base Currency Amount of the Rollover Loan that is due to be made) and its participation will be treated as a separate Loan denominated in the Base Currency during that Interest Period.

# 7.3 Facility Agent's Calculations

Each Lender's participation in a Loan will be determined in accordance with clause 6.4(b) (Lenders' Participation).
