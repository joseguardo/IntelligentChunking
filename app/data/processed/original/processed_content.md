Any interest accruing under this clause 13.3 shall be immediately payable by the Obligor on demand by the Facility Agent.

(b) If any overdue amount consists of all or part of a Loan which became due on a day which was not the last day of an Interest Period relating to that Loan:

(i) (where the Supplier is the person required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT) the Relevant Party must also pay to the Supplier (at the same time as paying that amount) an additional amount equal to the amount of the VAT. The Recipient must (where this paragraph (i) applies) promptly pay to the Relevant Party an amount equal to any credit or repayment the Recipient receives from the relevant tax authority which the Recipient reasonably determines relates to the VAT chargeable on that supply; and

(ii) (where the Recipient is the person required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT) the Relevant Party must promptly, following demand from the Recipient, pay to the Recipient an amount equal to the VAT chargeable on that supply but only to the extent that the Recipient reasonably determines that it is not entitled to credit or repayment from the relevant tax authority in respect of that VAT.

(c) Where a Senior Finance Document requires any Party to reimburse or indemnify a Senior Finance Party for any cost or expense, that Party shall reimburse or indemnify (as the case may be) such Senior Finance Party for the full amount of such cost or expense, including such part thereof as represents VAT, save to the extent that such Senior Finance Party reasonably determines that it is entitled to credit or repayment in respect of such VAT from the relevant tax authority.

(d) Any reference in this clause 17.7 to any Party shall, at any time when such Party is treated as a member of a group for VAT purposes, include (where appropriate and unless the context otherwise requires) a reference to the representative member of such group at such time (the term "representative member" to have the same meaning as in the Value Added Tax Act 1994 or in any equivalent legislation of another jurisdiction).

- (iii) any duty of confidentiality.

(d) If a Party fails to confirm whether or not it is a FATCA Exempt Party or to supply forms, documentation or other information requested in accordance with paragraph (a)(i) or (ii) above (including, for the avoidance of doubt, where clause 17.8(c) above applies), then such Party shall be treated for the purposes of the Senior Finance Documents (and payments under them) as if it is not a FATCA Exempt Party until such time as the Party in question provides the requested confirmation, forms, documentation or other information.

# 17.9 FATCA Deduction

(a) Each Party may make any FATCA Deduction it is required to make by FATCA, and any payment required in connection with that FATCA Deduction, and no Party shall be required to increase any payment in respect of which it makes such a FATCA Deduction or otherwise compensate the recipient of the payment for that FATCA Deduction.

# 22. Guarantee and Indemnity

This waiver applies irrespective of any law or any provision of a Senior Finance Document to the contrary.

- (b) hold in an interest-bearing suspense account any moneys received from any Guarantor or on account of any Guarantor's liability under this clause 22 (Guarantee and Indemnity).

(ii) If in any Financial Year (the "Original Financial Year") the amount of the Capital Expenditure actually spent is less than the Scheduled Capex for that Original Financial Year (the difference being the "Unused Amount"), then the Group's maximum Capital Expenditure for the immediately following Financial Year (the "Carry Forward Year") shall be increased by an amount (the "Permitted Carry Forward Amount") equal to the Unused Amount.

In any Carry Forward Year, the Permitted Carry Forward Amount shall be treated as having been incurred prior to the Scheduled Capex and no amount carried forward into that Carry Forward Year may be carried forward into a subsequent Financial Year.

An amount not exceeding 50 per cent of the Scheduled Capex for an Original Financial Year may be used for Capital Expenditure in the immediately preceding Financial Year (the “Prior Financial Year”) in addition to the Scheduled Capex which would otherwise be permitted in that Prior Financial Year (such amount the “Carry Back Capex”). The Carry Back Capex shall be deemed to be used after any Permitted Carry Forward Amount and after any Scheduled Capex otherwise permitted to be spent in that Prior Financial Year. The Scheduled Capex for any Financial Year shall be reduced by the amount of any Carry Back Capex relating to such Financial Year.

# 25.3 Financial Testing

(a) Subject to paragraph (b) below, the financial covenants set out in clause 25.2 (Financial Condition) shall be calculated in accordance with the Accounting Principles and tested by reference to each of the financial statements delivered pursuant to paragraphs (a)(i) and (b) of clause 24.1 (Financial Statements) and/or each Compliance Certificate delivered pursuant to clause 24.2 (Provision and Contents of Compliance Certificate).

(b) If the Annual Financial Statements are not available when any covenant referred to in clause 25.2 (Financial Condition) is tested, but when those Annual Financial Statements become available, they show that the figures in any relevant Quarterly Financial Statements utilised for any such calculation cannot have been substantially accurate, the Facility Agent may require such adjustments to the calculations which it, in its discretion, acting reasonably and in good faith considers appropriate to rectify that inaccuracy and compliance with the covenants in clause 25.2 (Financial Condition) will be determined by reference to those adjusted figures.

(c) For each of the Relevant Periods ending on a date which is less than 12 months after the Closing Date the financial covenants in clauses 24.2(a) to (c) (Financial Condition) shall be calculated for the period from the Closing Date to the end of the Relevant Period except that when calculating EBITDA for the purpose of clause 25.2(c) (Leverage), clause 25.2(d) (Super Senior EBITDA) and paragraph (f) of the definition of Permitted Payment, EBITDA will be annualised.

# 25.4 Equity Cure

(a) If the Parent is in breach of any obligation set out in paragraphs (a) (Cashflow Cover), (b) (Interest Cover) or (c) (Leverage) of clause 25.2 (Financial Condition) (each a "Financial Covenant"), then the Parent may procure the contribution of New Shareholder Injections which, subject to the conditions in paragraphs (b) to (f) (inclusive) below, shall have the effect that each Financial Covenant is recalculated giving effect to the following adjustments:

(i) for the purpose of calculating Cashflow Cover, the amount of the New Shareholder Injection shall be added to the calculation of Cashflow in respect of Cashflow Cover for the Relevant Period in which the breach of Financial Covenant has occurred (the "Breach Period") and the three Relevant Periods immediately following;

(ii) for the purpose of calculating Leverage, the amount of the New Shareholder Injection shall be deducted from the calculation of Total Debt for the Breach Period;

(iii) for the purpose of calculating Interest Cover, the amount of the New Shareholder Injection shall be treated (for this purpose only) as having been applied in prepayment of the Facilities in accordance with clause 11.3(a) (Application of Mandatory Prepayments and Cancellations) on the first day of the Breach Period, and Finance Charges for the Breach Period and the three Relevant Periods immediately following shall be recalculated accordingly (without double counting any reduction in Finance Charges arising as a result of any cure amount being used in prepayment of the Facilities),

in each case making any further adjustment needed to ensure no double counting or accumulation of cure benefit, and compliance with clause 25.2 (Financial Condition) will be determined by reference to the relevant recalculation.






# 25.4 New Shareholder Injections

(b) Any New Shareholder Injection made to effect a cure of a Financial Covenant:

1. must be contributed in cash and received by the Parent no later than the date which is 15 Business Days following the date for delivery of the Compliance Certificate which relates to the Breach Period;
2. may exceed the amount required to rectify the breach of Financial Covenant (the "Overcure Amount");
3. 50 per cent of that New Shareholder Injection which is required to remedy the breach of a Financial Covenant must be applied in prepayment of the Facilities in the order set out in clause 11.3(a) (Application of Mandatory Prepayments and Cancellations) immediately if the New Shareholder Injection was made to cure a breach of a Financial Covenant set out in paragraphs (b) (Interest Cover) or (c) (Leverage) of clause 25.2 (Financial Condition). If applied to cure a breach of paragraph (a) (Cashflow), the New Shareholder Injection shall be retained by the Group and may be used for any purpose not prohibited by this agreement;
4. must be made on the basis that such New Shareholder Injection shall have no cash yield until after the Senior Discharge Date has occurred (as such term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement).

(c) The contribution of New Shareholder Injections may only be made for the purpose of effecting a cure of a Financial Covenant breach a maximum of three times and not in two successive Relevant Periods and not more than once in each 12 Month period.

(d) The Overcure Amount shall be applied as determined by the Parent either in or towards permanent prepayment of Term Loans under this agreement or retained by the Group for the general corporate and working capital purposes of the Group.

(e) Any recalculation made under this clause 25.4 will be solely for the purpose of curing a breach of clause 25.2 (Financial Condition) and not for any other purpose such as calculation of Margin or Excess Cashflow or for determining application of Excess Cashflow.

(f) If after Total Debt and Finance Charges are reduced and, as the case may be, Cashflow is increased in accordance with this clause 25.4, the financial covenants in clauses 25.4(a), (b), (c) or (d) are complied with, the Parent shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of those financial covenants as for the relevant testing date with the same effect as if there had been no breach of any of those financial covenants and that Default shall be deemed remedied for all purposes under the Finance Documents.

- (a) assign any of its rights or transfer by way of assignment and assumption any of its rights and obligations; or
- (b) transfer by novation any of its rights and obligations; or
- (c) sub-participate all or any of its rights or obligations, under any Senior Finance Document to another bank or financial institution or to a trust, fund or other entity which is regularly engaged in or established for the purpose of making, purchasing or investing in loans, securities or other financial assets (the "New Lender") provided subject to Clause 28.2(b) (Conditions of Assignment, Transfer or Sub-participation) below always that as a consequence of any such assignment, transfer or sub-participation there are no more than, in aggregate, 6 Term Lenders (the "Syndicate Cap") and each New Lender’s Commitments are at least £1,000,000 (or if the New Lenders are Related Funds the aggregate amount of their Commitments is at least £1,000,000). For the avoidance of doubt, for the purposes of this clause 28 (Changes to Lenders), any Affiliate or Related Fund of any Lender shall be treated as being a single Lender (in aggregate) for the purposes of calculating the Syndicate Cap.

# 28.2 Conditions of Assignment, Transfer or Sub-Participation

- (a) An Existing Lender must obtain the prior consent of the Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed and consent shall be deemed given if no response is received by the Existing Lender within 10 Business Days of consent being requested) before it may make an assignment, sub-participation or transfer in accordance with clause 28.1 (Assignments and Transfers by the Lenders) unless the assignment, transfer or sub-participation is:
- (i) to another Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender;
- (ii) if the Existing Lender is a fund, to a fund which is a Related Fund of the Existing Lender;
- (iii) to an entity on the Approved List; or
- (iv) made at a time when an Event of Default is continuing.
- (b) If an assignment or transfer in connection with any Senior Finance Document is made at a time when an Event of Default is continuing, the Syndicate Cap shall not apply and there shall be no limit on the number of Lenders. After any such Event of Default has been remedied or waived in writing, the Syndicate Cap shall be increased by the number of New Lenders who have become a New Lender pursuant to clause 28.1 (Assignments and Transfers by the Lenders) above whilst the relevant Event of Default was continuing.
- (c) Any request for consent made under paragraph (a) above must also be simultaneously sent to Jeremy Morgan at the following address jeremymorgan@sovereigncapital.co.uk.

# Assignment and Transfer

(e) an assignment will only be effective on:

1. (i) receipt by the Facility Agent (whether in the Assignment Agreement or otherwise) of written confirmation from the New Lender (in form and substance satisfactory to the Facility Agent) that the New Lender will assume the same obligations to the other Senior Finance Parties and the other Secured Parties as it would have been under if it was an Original Lender;
2. (ii) the New Lender entering into the documentation required for it to accede to the Intercreditor Agreement (which requirement will be satisfied on completion of an assignment using the form of Assignment Agreement attached as schedule 5 (Form of Assignment Agreement));

(f) Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights and/or obligations (by whatever method) will be deemed to be subject (to the extent possible) to the rights and restrictions contained in the Intercreditor Agreement applicable to the Senior Lenders (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement). If the New Lender is not already a party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Senior Lender, then (for the benefit of the Senior Finance Parties) the New Lender agrees to become, with effect from the Transfer Date, a party to and agrees to be bound by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement as if it had originally been party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Senior Lender.

(g) A transfer will only be effective if the New Lender enters into the documentation required for it to accede as a party to the Intercreditor Agreement (which requirement will be satisfied on completion of a transfer using the form of Transfer Certificate attached as schedule 4 (Form of Transfer Certificate)) and if the procedure set out in clause 28.5 (Procedure for Transfer) is complied with.

(h) If:

1. (i) a Lender assigns or transfers any of its rights or obligations under the Senior Finance Documents or changes its Facility Office; and
2. (ii) as a result of circumstances existing at the date the assignment, transfer or change occurs, an Obligor would be obliged to make a payment to the New Lender or Lender acting through its new Facility Office under clause 18 (Increased Costs),

then the New Lender or Lender acting through its new Facility Office is only entitled to receive payment under that clause to the same extent as the Existing Lender or Lender acting through its previous Facility Office would have been if the assignment, transfer or change had not occurred.

(i) Each New Lender, by executing the relevant Transfer Certificate or Assignment Agreement, confirms, for the avoidance of doubt, that the Facility Agent has authority to execute on its behalf any amendment or waiver that has been approved by or on behalf of the requisite Lender or Lenders in accordance with this agreement on or prior to the date on which the transfer or assignment becomes.






effective in accordance with this agreement and that it is bound by that decision to the same extent as the Existing Lender would have been had it remained a Lender.

# 28.3 Assignment or Transfer Fee

# 28.4 Limitation of Responsibility of Existing Lenders

(a) Unless expressly agreed to the contrary, an Existing Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility to a New Lender for:

- (i) the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy or enforceability of the Transaction Documents, the Transaction Security or any other documents;
- (ii) the financial condition of any Obligor;
- (iii) the performance and observance by any Obligor or any other Group Company of its obligations under the Transaction Documents or any other documents; or
- (iv) the accuracy of any statements (whether written or oral) made in or in connection with any Transaction Document or any other document,

and any representations or warranties implied by law are excluded.

- (i) has made (and shall continue to make) its own independent investigation and assessment of the financial condition and affairs of each Obligor and its related entities in connection with its participation in this agreement and has not relied exclusively on any information provided to it by the Existing Lender or any other Senior Finance Party in connection with any Transaction Document or the Transaction Security; and
- (ii) will continue to make its own independent appraisal of the creditworthiness of each Obligor and its related entities whilst any amount is or may be outstanding under the Senior Finance Documents or any Commitment is in force.

(c) Nothing in any Senior Finance Document obliges an Existing Lender to:

- (i) accept a re-transfer or re-assignment from a New Lender of any of the rights and obligations assigned or transferred under this clause 28 (Changes to the Lenders); or
- (ii) support any losses directly or indirectly incurred by the New Lender by reason of the non-performance by any Obligor of its obligations under the Transaction Documents or otherwise.

# 28.5 Procedure for Transfer

(a) Subject to the conditions set out in clause 28.2 (Conditions of Assignment, Transfer or Sub-participation) a transfer is effected in accordance with paragraph (c) below when the Facility Agent executes an otherwise duly completed Transfer Certificate delivered to it by the Existing Lender and the New Lender. The Facility Agent shall,






# 28.5 Transfer Certificate

(c) Subject to clause 28.12 (Pro Rata Interest Settlement), on the Transfer Date:

1. to the extent that in the Transfer Certificate the Existing Lender seeks to transfer by novation its rights and obligations under the Senior Finance Documents, each of the Obligors and the Existing Lender shall be released from further obligations towards one another under the Senior Finance Documents and their respective rights against one another under the Senior Finance Documents shall be cancelled (being the "Discharged Rights and Obligations");
2. each of the Obligors and the New Lender shall assume obligations towards one another and/or acquire rights against one another which differ from the Discharged Rights and Obligations only insofar as that Obligor or other Group Company and the New Lender have assumed and/or acquired the same in place of that Obligor and the Existing Lender;
3. the Facility Agent, the Arranger, the Security Agent, the New Lender, the other Lenders and any relevant Ancillary Lender shall acquire the same rights and assume the same obligations between themselves and in respect of the Transaction Security as they would have acquired and assumed had the New Lender been an Original Lender with the rights, and/or obligations acquired or assumed by it as a result of the transfer and to that extent the Facility Agent, the Arranger, the Security Agent and any relevant Ancillary Lender and the Existing Lender shall each be released from further obligations to each other under the Senior Finance Documents; and

The Facility Agent shall, subject to paragraph (b) below, as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt by it of a duly completed Assignment Agreement appearing on its face to comply with the terms of this agreement and delivered in accordance with the terms of this agreement, execute that Assignment Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, an Assignment Agreement will be treated as duly completed notwithstanding that the Parent may not have executed that Assignment Agreement to formally acknowledge the transfer of obligations.

(b) The Facility Agent shall only be obliged to execute an Assignment Agreement delivered to it by the Existing Lender and the New Lender once it is satisfied it has complied with all necessary "know your customer" or other similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations in relation to the assignment to such New Lender.






(c) Subject to clause 28.12 (Pro Rata Interest Settlement), on the Transfer Date:

1. the Existing Lender will assign absolutely to the New Lender its rights under the Senior Finance Documents and in respect of the Transaction Security expressed to be the subject of the assignment in the Assignment Agreement;
2. the Existing Lender will be released from the obligations (the "Relevant Obligations") expressed to be the subject of the release in the Assignment Agreement (and any corresponding obligations by which it is bound in respect of the Transaction Security); and

(d) Lenders may utilise procedures other than those set out in this clause 28.6 to assign their rights under the Senior Finance Documents provided that they comply with the conditions set out in clause 28.2 (Conditions of Assignment, Transfer or Sub-Participation).

# 28.8 New CAR Facility Lender

1. each of the Obligors will owe obligations to the CAR Facility Lender in accordance with the terms of the Senior Finance Documents;
2. subject to any limits recorded in the Senior Finance Documents, the guarantees and security recorded in the Senior Finance Documents in favour of the Senior Finance Parties will extend to the CAR Facility Lender and the CAR Facility Loans; and
3. the Senior Finance Parties in each of their respective capacities shall acquire the rights and assume the obligations between themselves as if the CAR Facility Lender had been an original lender under this agreement in that capacity.

# 28.9 Accession of Hedge Counterparties

2. Where this agreement or any other Senior Finance Document imposes an obligation on a Hedge Counterparty and the relevant Hedge Counterparty is an Affiliate of a Lender and is not a party to that document, the relevant Lender shall ensure that the obligation is performed by its Affiliate.





# 28.10 Security over Lenders' Rights

In addition to the other rights provided to Lenders under this clause 28 (Changes to the Lenders), each Lender may without consulting with or obtaining consent from any Obligor, at any time charge, assign or otherwise create Security in or over (whether by way of collateral or otherwise) all or any of its rights under any Senior Finance Document to secure obligations of that Lender including, without limitation:

- (a) any charge, assignment or other Security to secure obligations to a federal reserve or central bank; and
- (b) in the case of any Lender which is a fund, any charge, assignment or other Security granted to any holders (or trustee or representatives of holders) of obligations owed, or securities issued, by that Lender as security for those obligations or securities,

except that no such charge, assignment or Security shall:

- (i) release a Lender from any of its obligations under the Senior Finance Documents or substitute the beneficiary of the relevant charge, assignment or Security for the Lender as a party to any of the Senior Finance Documents; or

# 28.11 Continuation of Security

(a) Each Obligor consents to the assignments and transfers of rights and obligations permitted under and made in accordance with this clause 28 (Changes to the Lenders). Each Obligor agrees and confirms that its guarantee and indemnity obligations under the Senior Finance Documents and any Transaction Security granted by it in support of its own borrowing obligations or its guarantee or indemnity obligations under the Senior Finance Documents will continue notwithstanding any assignment or transfer under this clause 28 (Changes to the Lenders) and will extend to cover and support obligations owed to New Lenders and to continuing Senior Finance Parties.

(b) The Parent (for itself and as agent for the Obligors) will (at its own cost) as soon as reasonably practicable execute such documents and take such other actions as are necessary to effect or perfect an assignment or a transfer of rights and/or obligations to a New Lender under the Senior Finance Documents. Such action will include:

- (i) promptly countersigning Assignment Agreements (although any delay or failure by the Parent to so countersign an Assignment Agreement will not invalidate its operation); and
- (ii) subject to the Agreed Security Principles taking such steps as the Facility Agent or the Security Agent may request (including re-execution of Transaction Security Documents) for the purpose of ensuring that the New Lender has (and the other Senior Finance Parties continue to have) the benefit of the same security interests under the Transaction Security Documents as existed immediately before the relevant transfer.




# 28.12 Pro Rata Interest Settlement

If the Facility Agent has notified the Lenders that it is able to distribute interest payments on a "pro rata basis" to Existing Lenders and New Lenders then (in respect of any transfer pursuant to clause 28.5 (Procedure for Transfer) or any assignment pursuant to clause 28.6 (Procedure for Assignment or Assignment and Assumption) the Transfer Date of which, in each case, is after the date of such notification and is not on the last day of an Interest Period):

1. any interest or fees in respect of the relevant participation which are expressed to accrue by reference to the lapse of time shall continue to accrue in favour of the Existing Lender up to but excluding the Transfer Date ("Accrued Amounts") and shall become due and payable to the Existing Lender (without further interest accruing on them) on the last day of the current Interest Period (or, if the Interest Period is longer than six Months, on the next of the dates which falls at six-Monthly intervals after the first day of that Interest Period); and

3. the Parent shall, by 5.00 p.m. on the sixth Business Day following the date on which an Open Order is placed, notify the Facility Agent of the amounts of the participations purchased through such Open Order Process and the identity of the Term Facility or CAR Facility to which they relate. The Facility Agent shall promptly disclose such information to the Lenders.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, there is no limit on the number of occasions a Solicitation Process or an Open Order Process may be implemented.

(f) In relation to any Debt Purchase Transaction entered into pursuant to this clause 29 (Debt Purchase Transactions), notwithstanding any other term of this agreement or the other Senior Finance Documents:

# 37. CALCULATIONS AND CERTIFICATES

# 37.1 Accounts

In any litigation or arbitration proceedings arising out of or in connection with a Senior Finance Document, the entries made in the accounts maintained by a Senior Finance Party are prima facie evidence of the matters to which they relate.

# 37.2 Certificates and Determinations

Any certification or determination by a Senior Finance Party of a rate or amount under any Senior Finance Document is, in the absence of manifest error, prima facie evidence of the matters to which it relates.

# 37.3 Day Count Convention

Any interest, commission or fee accruing under a Senior Finance Document will accrue from day to day and is calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed and a year of 360 days or, in any case where the practice in the Relevant Interbank Market differs, in accordance with that market practice.

# 38. PARTIAL INVALIDITY

If, at any time, any provision of a Senior Finance Document is or becomes illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect under any law of any jurisdiction, neither the legality, validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions nor the legality, validity or enforceability of such provision under the law of any other jurisdiction will in any way be affected or impaired.

# 39. REMEDIES AND WAIVERS

No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part of any Senior Finance Party or Secured Party, any right or remedy under a Senior Finance Document shall operate as a waiver of any such right or remedy or constitute an election to affirm any Senior Finance Document. No election to affirm any Senior Finance Document on the part of any Senior Finance Party or Secured Party shall be effective unless it is in writing. No single or partial exercise of any right or remedy shall prevent any further or other exercise or the exercise of any other right or remedy. The rights and remedies provided in each Senior Finance Document are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.

# 40. AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS

# 40.1 Intercreditor Agreement

This clause 40 is subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

# 40.2 Required Consents

(a) Subject to clauses 40.3 (All Lender Matters) to 40.7 (Excluded Commitments) (inclusive) and the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any term of the Senior Finance Documents may be amended or waived only with the consent of the Majority Lenders and the Parent and any such amendment or waiver will be binding on all Parties.

(b) The Facility Agent may effect, on behalf of any Senior Finance Party, any amendment or waiver permitted by this clause 40 (Amendments and Waivers).






(c) Without prejudice to the generality of paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) of clause 31.7 (Rights and Discretions), the Facility Agent may engage, pay for and rely on the services of lawyers in determining the consent level required for and effecting any amendment, waiver or consent under this agreement.

(d) Each Obligor agrees to any such amendment or waiver permitted by this clause 40 (Amendments and Waivers) which is agreed to by the Parent. This includes any amendment or waiver which would, but for this paragraph (d), require the consent of all of the Guarantors.

(e) If a decision of the Lenders is required, then each Lender which has Commitments in respect of which it is entitled to cast a vote or votes ("Eligible Commitments") may elect to vote all or only part of those Eligible Commitments and may also vote part of its Eligible Commitments in one way whilst voting another part of its Eligible Commitments in another way.

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, an amendment or waiver which requires the consent of all the Lenders requires 100 per cent of Eligible Commitments to be cast in favour and not merely all of the Lender institutions to vote in favour. The same principle applies mutatis mutandis to Majority Lender and Majority Revolving Facility Lender decision making.

- (g) any provision which expressly requires the consent of all the Lenders;
- (h) the definition of "CAR Facility Maximum Amount" and/or Clause 3.4(a) (CAR Facility);
- (i) the definition of "CAR Facility Maximum Margin", Clauses 3.4(d) and/or Clauses 3.5 (CAR Facility) and 3.20 (Lender’s right in relation to a CAR Facility);
- (j) clause 2.3 (Senior Finance Parties' Rights and Obligations), clause 11.3 (Application of Mandatory Prepayments and Cancellations), clause 12.10 (Application of Prepayments), clause 26.36 (Guarantors), clause 28 (Changes to the Lenders),

1. a Material Event of Default, the definition of "Material Event of Default" or the definitions used therein;
2. the provisions of clause 24.1 (Financial statements) or clause 24.2 (Provision and Contents of Compliance Certificate) which has the effect of delaying the delivery of the financial statements or Compliance Certificate (as the case may be) referred to therein by more than 30 days (beyond the time limits contemplated by those provisions in their original form);
3. the definitions of "Permitted Security" or the provisions of clause 26.15 (Negative Pledge) to the extent that the effect of such amendment or waiver is to permit the incurrence of Security that ranks pari passu or in priority to the Revolving Facility and would be materially adverse to the interests of the Lenders under the Revolving Facility Lenders;
4. clause 27.6 (Insolvency), clause 27.7 (Insolvency Proceedings) or clause 27.8 (Creditors' Process) to the extent such change would be materially adverse to the interest of the Lenders under the Revolving Facility;

shall require the consent of the Majority Lenders and the Majority Revolving Lenders.

Any waiver of a Material Event of Default shall not require any consent of the Majority Lenders, provided that, where the event or circumstance that caused such Material Event of Default has also resulted in a Default, such Default may only be waived by the Majority Lenders, but for the avoidance of doubt any waiver of such Default by the Majority Lenders will not constitute a waiver of the corresponding Material Event of Default.

# 40.5 Approved List

(a) Subject to paragraph (b) below, the Approved List may be amended with the prior written consent of the Facility Agent (acting on the instruction of the Majority Lenders) and the Parent provided that the number of banks and financial institutions on the Approved List is not reduced at any time.

(b) The Parent may, subject to giving five Business Days prior notice to the Facility Agent, in its sole discretion:

(g) The Facility Agent shall make available the Approved List for review by a Lender or a prospective New Lender at its request for the purposes of verifying of such Lender's compliance with the provisions of this agreement.

# 40.6 Other Exceptions

(b) Any manifest error in the Senior Finance Documents which is of a typographical nature may be amended by agreement between the Facility Agent and the Parent and any such amendment will be binding on all Parties.

# 40.7 Excluded Commitments

(unless, in either case, the Parent and the Facility Agent agree to a longer time period in relation to any request):

# Form of Assignment Agreement

[This Assignment Agreement operates by way of ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION (as opposed to novation). Care needs to be taken to ensure this does not trigger stamp duties or other transfer taxes.]

[Execution and delivery of this Assignment Agreement may not of itself be sufficient to transfer the underlying security. Advice should be taken from lawyers in the jurisdictions where the security providers are incorporated.]

[Each of the existing lender and new lender should ensure that all regulatory requirements are satisfied in connection with this Assignment Agreement – including those necessary to remove the transferred assets from the regulatory balance sheet of the existing lender.]

To: [●] as Facility Agent and [●] as Parent, for and on behalf of each Obligor

From: [the Existing Lender] (the "Existing Lender") and [the New Lender] (the "New Lender")

Dated:

[Parent – [●] Senior Facilities Agreement dated [●] (the "Facilities Agreement")

# 1.

We refer to the Facilities Agreement and to the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined in the Facilities Agreement). This is an Assignment Agreement. This agreement (the "Agreement") shall take effect as an Assignment Agreement for the purpose of the Facilities Agreement and as a Creditor Accession Undertaking for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement (and as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement). Terms defined in the Facilities Agreement have the same meaning in this Agreement unless given a different meaning in this Agreement.

# 2.

We refer to clause 28.6 (Procedure for Assignment or Assignment and Assumption) of the Facilities Agreement:

(a) The Existing Lender assigns absolutely to the New Lender all the rights of the Existing Lender under the Facilities Agreement, the other Senior Finance Documents and in respect of the Transaction Security which correspond to that portion of the Existing Lender's Commitment(s) and participations in Utilisations under the Facilities Agreement as specified in the schedule.

(b) The Existing Lender is released from all the obligations of the Existing Lender which correspond to that portion of the Existing Lender's Commitment(s) and participations in Utilisations under the Facilities Agreement specified in the schedule.

(c) The New Lender becomes a Party as a Lender, assumes and is bound by obligations equivalent to those from which the Existing Lender is released under paragraph (b) above.

# 3.

The proposed Transfer Date is [●].

# 4.

On the Transfer Date the New Lender becomes:

(a) Party to the relevant Senior Finance Documents (other than the Intercreditor Agreement) as a Lender;

# 5.

The New Lender expressly acknowledges the limitations on the Existing Lender's obligations set out in clause 28.4(c) (Limitation of Responsibility of Existing Lenders) of the Facilities Agreement.

# 6.

The Existing Lender represents and warrants that:

- (a) the rights assigned hereunder are assigned free of any rights of set-off in favour of any Obligor and free of any lien, security interest or other encumbrance; and
- (b) immediately prior to the Transfer Date, the Existing Lender is the beneficial owner of the rights to be assigned hereunder.

The Facility Office and address, fax number and attention details for notices of the New Lender for the purposes of clause 36.2 (Addresses) of the Facilities Agreement are set out in the schedule.

- (b) [a Treaty Lender;]

# 9.

[The New Lender confirms that the person beneficially entitled to interest payable to that Lender in respect of an advance under a Senior Finance Document is either:

- (a) a company resident in the United Kingdom for United Kingdom tax purposes; or
- (b) a partnership each member of which is:
- - (i) a company so resident in the United Kingdom; or
- (ii) a company not so resident in the United Kingdom which carries on a trade in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment and which brings into account in computing its chargeable profits (within the meaning of section 19 of the CTA) the whole of any share of interest payable in respect of that advance that falls to it by reason of Part 17 of the CTA; or

(c) a company not so resident in the United Kingdom which carries on a trade in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment and which brings into account interest payable in respect of that advance in computing the chargeable profits (within the meaning of section 19 of the CTA) of that company.]

SCHEDULE 10

# Agreed Security Principles

# 1. THE PRINCIPLES

The guarantees and Security to be provided in support of the Facilities (and any related hedging arrangements In respect of the types of liabilities and/or risks which the Hedging Letter requires to be hedged) will be given in accordance with the agreed security principles set out in this schedule.

# 2. POTENTIAL RESTRICTIONS ON CREDIT SUPPORT

The Agreed Security Principles recognise that there may be legal and practical difficulties in obtaining security from all Obligors in every jurisdiction in which Obligors are incorporated or operate. In particular:

- (a) general statutory limitations, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, thin capitalisation rules, capital maintenance, exchange control restrictions, retention of title claims and similar principles may limit the ability of a member of the Group to provide a guarantee or grant security or may require that its guarantee be limited in amount or scope. The Parent will use all reasonable endeavours to assist in demonstrating that adequate corporate benefit accrues to the Target and each Obligor;
- (b) the Security and extent of its perfection will be agreed taking into account the economic cost to the Group of providing Security and the proportionate benefit accruing to the Lenders having regard to the extent of the obligations which can be secured by that Security and the priority that will be offered by taking or perfecting the Security;
- (c) any assets subject to pre-existing third party arrangements which are permitted by this agreement and which prevent those assets from being charged will be excluded from any relevant Transaction Security Document but the Obligors must use reasonable endeavours to obtain consent to charging any such assets if the relevant asset is material;
- (d) Guarantors will not be required to give guarantees or enter into security documents if that would conflict with the mandatory fiduciary duties of their or any Affiliates' directors or contravene any legal prohibition or result in a risk of personal or criminal liability on the part of any officer or member of such company provided that the relevant Guarantor shall use reasonable endeavours to overcome any such obstacle to the extent that that can be done at reasonable cost;
- (e) Guarantors will not be required to give guarantees or enter into Security where the Guarantor can demonstrate that there would be a significant Tax cost disadvantage in doing so such that the cost of giving such guarantees or entering into such Security would be disproportionate to the benefit of such guarantee and/or Security to the Lenders, provided that the relevant Guarantor shall use reasonable endeavours to overcome any such obstacle to the extent that can be done at reasonable cost;
- (f) perfection of Security, when required, and other legal formalities will be completed as soon as practicable and, in any event, within the time periods specified in the Senior Finance Documents therefore or (If earlier or to the extent no such time periods are specified in the Senior Finance Documents) within the time periods specified by applicable law in order to ensure due perfection;

UK - 205885966.10                                        221





(g) the perfection of Security granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect on the commercial reputation of the relevant Guarantor or on its ability to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise not prohibited by the Senior Finance Documents;

(h) access to the assets of a Guarantor, the maximum guaranteed or secured amount may be restricted or limited by guarantee limitation language agreed to reflect these principles and to the extent consistent with them, customary practice in the relevant jurisdiction to minimise stamp duty, notarisation, registration or other applicable fees where the economic benefit of increasing the guaranteed or secured amount is disproportionate to the level of such fees, Taxes and duties or where registration, notarial or other fees are payable by reference to the stated amount secured in which case, any asset Security granted by that Guarantor shall be limited to the maximum recoverable amount under the guarantee;

(i) where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of granting Security over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such Security, Security will be granted over the material assets only;

(j) unless granted under a global security document governed by the law of the jurisdiction of a Guarantor or under English law all Security (other than share Security over its Guarantor subsidiaries) shall be governed by the law of and secure assets located in the jurisdiction of incorporation of that Guarantor;

(k) no perfection action will be required in jurisdictions where Guarantors are not located (other than in relation to any security over shares or equity interests or in intellectual property) but perfection action may be required in the jurisdiction of one Obligor in relation to security granted by an Obligor located in a different jurisdiction;

(l) to the extent possible, the Security Agent will hold one set of security for the Lenders and the Hedge Counterparties;
