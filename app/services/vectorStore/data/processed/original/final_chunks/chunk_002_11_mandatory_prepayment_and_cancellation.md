- (i) any amounts credited to the Mandatory Prepayment Account when no Revolving Facility Standstill Period is continuing;
- (ii) any amounts in excess of the Revolving Facility Commitments when a Revolving Facility Standstill Period is continuing; and
- (iii) amounts credited to the Holding Account which have not been applied in replacement, reinstatement or repair or to fund a Permitted Acquisition or Capital Expenditure (as the case may be) within the requisite period (or such longer time period as the Majority Lenders may agree),

to pay amounts due and payable under clause 11.3 (Application of Mandatory Prepayments and Cancellations) and otherwise under the Senior Finance Documents. The Parent and each Borrower further irrevocably authorise the Facility Agent to so apply amounts credited to the Holding Account if a Declared Default has occurred and is continuing.

(c) A Lender, Security Agent or Facility Agent with which a Mandatory Prepayment Account or Holding Account is held acknowledges and agrees that:

- (i) interest shall accrue at normal commercial rates on amounts credited to those accounts and that the account holder shall be entitled to receive such

interest (which shall be paid in accordance with the mandate relating to such account) unless a Declared Default is continuing; and

(ii) each such account is subject to the Transaction Security.

# 11.5 Excluded Proceeds

Where Excluded Disposal Proceeds, Excluded Acquisition Proceeds and Excluded Insurance Proceeds include amounts which are intended to be used for a specific purpose within a specified period (as set out in the relevant definitions of "Excluded Disposal Proceeds", "Excluded Acquisition Proceeds" or "Excluded Insurance Proceeds"), the Parent shall ensure that those amounts are used for that purpose and, if requested to do so by the Facility Agent, shall as soon as reasonably practicable after a request deliver a certificate to the Facility Agent confirming the amount (if any) which has been so applied within the requisite time periods provided for in the relevant definition.

# 11.6 Revolving Facility Standstill and Significant Disposals

(a) At any time that a Revolving Facility Standstill Period is continuing, the Parent shall ensure that any proceeds received (not to exceed an amount equal to the Revolving Facility Commitments at that time):

(i) pursuant to clause 11.2 (Disposal, Insurance and Acquisition Proceeds and Excess Cashflow); or

(ii) from the proceeds of a Significant Disposal which the Majority Revolving Facility Lenders have not consented to,

are paid into a Mandatory Prepayment Account as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt by a Group Company and are not to be applied in accordance with clause 11.3 (Application of Mandatory Prepayments and Cancellations) above until such time as the Revolving Facility Standstill Period has ended. If, following the end of the Revolving Facility Standstill Period, the Majority Revolving Facility Lenders are:

(i) not entitled to accelerate under the Senior Finance Documents in accordance with clause 27.20 (Revolving Facility Acceleration) and take enforcement action in accordance with clause 3.9 (Permitted Enforcement: Revolving Facility Lenders) of the Intercreditor Agreement, then the proceeds received shall be applied in accordance with clause 11.3 (Application of Mandatory Prepayments and Cancellation); or

(ii) entitled to enforce under the Senior Finance Documents in accordance with clause 27.20 (Revolving Facility Acceleration) and take enforcement action in accordance with clause 3.9 (Permitted Enforcement: Revolving Facility Lenders) of the Intercreditor Agreement, then the proceeds received shall be applied in accordance with clause 17 (Application of Proceeds) of the Intercreditor Agreement.

(b) The Parent shall ensure that:

(i) if a Significant Disposal occurs it shall promptly notify the Facility Agent and/or Majority Revolving Facility Lenders; and

(ii) any proceeds received (not to exceed an amount equal to the Revolving Facility Commitments at that time) from the proceeds of a Significant Disposal which the Majority Revolving Facility Lenders have not consented to, are paid into a Mandatory Prepayment Account as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt by a Group Company and are not to be applied in
