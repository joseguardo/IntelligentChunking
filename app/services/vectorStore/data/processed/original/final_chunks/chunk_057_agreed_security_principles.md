# 28.12 Pro Rata Interest Settlement

If the Facility Agent has notified the Lenders that it is able to distribute interest payments on a "pro rata basis" to Existing Lenders and New Lenders then (in respect of any transfer pursuant to clause 28.5 (Procedure for Transfer) or any assignment pursuant to clause 28.6 (Procedure for Assignment or Assignment and Assumption) the Transfer Date of which, in each case, is after the date of such notification and is not on the last day of an Interest Period):

1. any interest or fees in respect of the relevant participation which are expressed to accrue by reference to the lapse of time shall continue to accrue in favour of the Existing Lender up to but excluding the Transfer Date ("Accrued Amounts") and shall become due and payable to the Existing Lender (without further interest accruing on them) on the last day of the current Interest Period (or, if the Interest Period is longer than six Months, on the next of the dates which falls at six-Monthly intervals after the first day of that Interest Period); and
2. the rights assigned or transferred by the Existing Lender will not include the right to the Accrued Amounts so that, for the avoidance of doubt:

1. when the Accrued Amounts become payable, those Accrued Amounts will be payable for the account of the Existing Lender; and
2. the amount payable to the New Lender on that date will be the amount which would, but for the application of this clause 28.12, have been payable to it on that date, but after deduction of the Accrued Amounts.
3. In this clause 28.12 references to "Interest Period" shall be construed to include a reference to any other period for accrual of fees.
