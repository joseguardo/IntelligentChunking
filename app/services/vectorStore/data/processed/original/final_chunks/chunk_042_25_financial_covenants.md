1. must be contributed in cash and received by the Parent no later than the date which is 15 Business Days following the date for delivery of the Compliance Certificate which relates to the Breach Period;
2. may exceed the amount required to rectify the breach of Financial Covenant (the "Overcure Amount");
3. 50 per cent of that New Shareholder Injection which is required to remedy the breach of a Financial Covenant must be applied in prepayment of the Facilities in the order set out in clause 11.3(a) (Application of Mandatory Prepayments and Cancellations) immediately if the New Shareholder Injection was made to cure a breach of a Financial Covenant set out in paragraphs (b) (Interest Cover) or (c) (Leverage) of clause 25.2 (Financial Condition). If applied to cure a breach of paragraph (a) (Cashflow), the New Shareholder Injection shall be retained by the Group and may be used for any purpose not prohibited by this agreement; and
4. must be made on the basis that such New Shareholder Injection shall have no cash yield until after the Senior Discharge Date has occurred (as such term is defined in the Intercreditor Agreement).

(c) The contribution of New Shareholder Injections may only be made for the purpose of effecting a cure of a Financial Covenant breach a maximum of three times and not in two successive Relevant Periods and not more than once in each 12 Month period.

(d) The Overcure Amount shall be applied as determined by the Parent either in or towards permanent prepayment of Term Loans under this agreement or retained by the Group for the general corporate and working capital purposes of the Group.

(e) Any recalculation made under this clause 25.4 will be solely for the purpose of curing a breach of clause 25.2 (Financial Condition) and not for any other purpose such as calculation of Margin or Excess Cashflow or for determining application of Excess Cashflow.

(f) If after Total Debt and Finance Charges are reduced and, as the case may be, Cashflow is increased in accordance with this clause 25.4, the financial covenants in clauses 25.4(a), (b), (c) or (d) are complied with, the Parent shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of those financial covenants as for the relevant testing date with the same effect as if there had been no breach of any of those financial covenants and that Default shall be deemed remedied for all purposes under the Finance Documents.
