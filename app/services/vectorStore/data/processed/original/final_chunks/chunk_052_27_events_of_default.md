# 27.21 Clean-up period

Notwithstanding any other provision of any Finance Document, any Event of Default constituting a Clean-up Default will be deemed not to be a breach of representation or warranty, a breach of covenant or an Event of Default (as the case may be) if:

(a) it would have been (if it were not for this provision) a breach of representation or warranty, a breach of covenant or an Event of Default only by reason of circumstances relating exclusively to any member to the Target Group (or any obligation to procure or ensure in relation to a member of the Target Group) (in the case of the Acquisition) or (in the case of an acquisition permitted under and in accordance with paragraph (f) of the definition of "Permitted Acquisition", an "Acquisition Target") the Acquisition Target or any other person, undertaking or business which is the direct or indirect subject of the relevant acquisition (or any obligation to procure or ensure in relation to the Acquisition Target or any such other person, undertaking or business);

(b) it is capable of remedy and reasonable steps are being taken to remedy it;

(c) the circumstances giving rise to it have not been procured by or approved by the Parent, or any Investor (in the case of the Acquisition) or (in the case of the acquisition permitted under and in accordance with the paragraph (f) of the definition of "Permitted Acquisition" any member of the Group); and

(d) it is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

If the relevant circumstances are continuing on or after the Clean-up Date, there shall be a breach of representation or warranty, breach of covenant or Event of Default, as the case may be, notwithstanding the above (and without prejudice to the rights and remedies of the Finance Parties).

# 27.22 Exchange Rate Fluctuations

When applying baskets, thresholds and other exceptions to the representations and warranties, undertakings and Events of Default under the agreement, the equivalent to an amount in the Base Currency shall be calculated as at the date of the Group incurring or making the relevant disposal, acquisition, investment, lease, loan, debt or guarantee or taking other relevant action. No Event of Default or breach of any representation and warranty or undertaking shall arise merely as a result of a subsequent change in the Base Currency equivalent of any relevant amount due to fluctuations in exchange rates.
