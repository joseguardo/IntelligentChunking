If the Obligor has used its reasonable endeavours but has not been able to obtain acknowledgement, its obligation to obtain acknowledgement shall cease on the expiry of that 20 Business Day period irrespective of whether notice of the Security is required for perfection, if the service of notice would prevent the Obligor from using a bank account, other than in the case of the Mandatory Prepayment Account, Holding Account or any other blocked account, in the ordinary course of its business no notice of security shall be served until the occurrence of a Declared Default.
