# (e) Capital Expenditure:

(i) Subject to paragraph (ii) below, the aggregate Capital Expenditure of the Group (other than Capital Expenditure funded by the retention of the proceeds of Recovery Claims, Disposals and insurance claims in accordance with clause 11.5 (Excluded Proceeds) or from New Shareholder Injections or the Overfund Amount or funded or refunded from any CAR Facility Loan) in respect of any Financial Year specified in column 1 below shall not exceed the higher of: (i) 130% of the Capex Budget for that Financial Year and (ii) the amount set out in column 2 below opposite that Financial Year (the higher amount being the "Scheduled Capex").

| Column 1              | Column 2            |
| --------------------- | ------------------- |
| Financial Year Ending | Maximum Expenditure |
| 31 March 2017         | £449,000            |
| 31 March 2018         | £633,000            |
| 31 March 2019         | £332,000            |
| 31 March 2020         | £514,000            |
| 31 March 2021         | £351,000            |

| 31 March 2023         | £351,000            |

(ii) If in any Financial Year (the "Original Financial Year") the amount of the Capital Expenditure actually spent is less than the Scheduled Capex for that Original Financial Year (the difference being the "Unused Amount"), then the Group's maximum Capital Expenditure for the immediately following Financial Year (the "Carry Forward Year") shall be increased by an amount (the "Permitted Carry Forward Amount") equal to the Unused Amount.

In any Carry Forward Year, the Permitted Carry Forward Amount shall be treated as having been incurred prior to the Scheduled Capex and no amount carried forward into that Carry Forward Year may be carried forward into a subsequent Financial Year.

An amount not exceeding 50 per cent of the Scheduled Capex for an Original Financial Year may be used for Capital Expenditure in the immediately preceding Financial Year (the "Prior Financial Year") in addition to the Scheduled Capex which would otherwise be permitted in that Prior Financial Year (such amount the "Carry Back Capex"). The Carry Back Capex shall be deemed to be used after any Permitted Carry Forward Amount and after any Scheduled Capex otherwise permitted to be spent in that Prior Financial Year. The Scheduled Capex for any Financial Year shall be reduced by the amount of any Carry Back Capex relating to such Financial Year.

# 25.3 Financial Testing

(a) Subject to paragraph (b) below, the financial covenants set out in clause 25.2 (Financial Condition) shall be calculated in accordance with the Accounting Principles and tested by reference to each of the financial statements delivered pursuant to paragraphs (a)(i) and (b) of clause 24.1 (Financial Statements) and/or each Compliance Certificate delivered pursuant to clause 24.2 (Provision and Contents of Compliance Certificate).

(b) If the Annual Financial Statements are not available when any covenant referred to in clause 25.2 (Financial Condition) is tested, but when those Annual Financial Statements become available, they show that the figures in any relevant Quarterly Financial Statements utilised for any such calculation cannot have been substantially accurate, the Facility Agent may require such adjustments to the calculations which it, in its discretion, acting reasonably and in good faith considers appropriate to rectify that inaccuracy and compliance with the covenants in clause 25.2 (Financial Condition) will be determined by reference to those adjusted figures.

(c) For each of the Relevant Periods ending on a date which is less than 12 months after the Closing Date the financial covenants in clauses 24.2(a) to (c) (Financial Condition) shall be calculated for the period from the Closing Date to the end of the Relevant Period except that when calculating EBITDA for the purpose of clause 25.2(c) (Leverage), clause 25.2(d) (Super Senior EBITDA) and paragraph (f) of the definition of Permitted Payment, EBITDA will be annualised.

# 25.4 Equity Cure

(a) If the Parent is in breach of any obligation set out in paragraphs (a) (Cashflow Cover), (b) (Interest Cover) or (c) (Leverage) of clause 25.2 (Financial Condition) (each a "Financial Covenant"), then the Parent may procure the contribution of New Shareholder Injections which, subject to the conditions in paragraphs (b) to (f) (inclusive) below, shall have the effect that each Financial Covenant is recalculated giving effect to the following adjustments:

(i) for the purpose of calculating Cashflow Cover, the amount of the New Shareholder Injection shall be added to the calculation of Cashflow in respect of Cashflow Cover for the Relevant Period in which the breach of Financial Covenant has occurred (the "Breach Period") and the three Relevant Periods immediately following;

(ii) for the purpose of calculating Leverage, the amount of the New Shareholder Injection shall be deducted from the calculation of Total Debt for the Breach Period;

(iii) for the purpose of calculating Interest Cover, the amount of the New Shareholder Injection shall be treated (for this purpose only) as having been applied in prepayment of the Facilities in accordance with clause 11.3(a) (Application of Mandatory Prepayments and Cancellations) on the first day of the Breach Period, and Finance Charges for the Breach Period and the three Relevant Periods immediately following shall be recalculated accordingly (without double counting any reduction in Finance Charges arising as a result of any cure amount being used in prepayment of the Facilities),

in each case making any further adjustment needed to ensure no double counting or accumulation of cure benefit, and compliance with clause 25.2 (Financial Condition) will be determined by reference to the relevant recalculation.

# 25.4 New Shareholder Injections

(b) Any New Shareholder Injection made to effect a cure of a Financial Covenant:
