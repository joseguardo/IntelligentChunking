28. CHANGES TO THE LENDERS

# 28.1 Assignments and Transfers by the Lenders

Subject to this clause 28 (Changes to the Lenders) and to clause 29 (Debt Purchase Transactions), a Lender (the "Existing Lender") may:

- (a) assign any of its rights or transfer by way of assignment and assumption any of its rights and obligations; or
- (b) transfer by novation any of its rights and obligations; or
- (c) sub-participate all or any of its rights or obligations,

under any Senior Finance Document to another bank or financial institution or to a trust, fund or other entity which is regularly engaged in or established for the purpose of making, purchasing or investing in loans, securities or other financial assets (the "New Lender") provided subject to Clause 28.2(b) (Conditions of Assignment, Transfer or Sub-participation) below always that as a consequence of any such assignment, transfer or sub-participation there are no more than, in aggregate, 6 Term Lenders (the "Syndicate Cap") and each New Lender's Commitments are at least £1,000,000 (or if the New Lenders are Related Funds the aggregate amount of their Commitments is at least £1,000,000). For the avoidance of doubt, for the purposes of this clause 28 (Changes to Lenders), any Affiliate or Related Fund of any Lender shall be treated as being a single Lender (in aggregate) for the purposes of calculating the Syndicate Cap.

# 28.2 Conditions of Assignment, Transfer or Sub-Participation

- (a) An Existing Lender must obtain the prior consent of the Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed and consent shall be deemed given if no response is received by the Existing Lender within 10 Business Days of consent being requested) before it may make an assignment, sub-participation or transfer in accordance with clause 28.1 (Assignments and Transfers by the Lenders) unless the assignment, transfer or sub-participation is:
- - (i) to another Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender;
- (ii) if the Existing Lender is a fund, to a fund which is a Related Fund of the Existing Lender;
- (iii) to an entity on the Approved List; or
- (iv) made at a time when an Event of Default is continuing.

(b) If an assignment or transfer in connection with any Senior Finance Document is made at a time when an Event of Default is continuing, the Syndicate Cap shall not apply and there shall be no limit on the number of Lenders. After any such Event of Default has been remedied or waived in writing, the Syndicate Cap shall be increased by the number of New Lenders who have become a New Lender pursuant to clause 28.1 (Assignments and Transfers by the Lenders) above whilst the relevant Event of Default was continuing.
- (c) Any request for consent made under paragraph (a) above must also be simultaneously sent to Jeremy Morgan at the following address jeremymorgan@sovereigncapital.co.uk.
- (d) Each assignment or transfer of any Lender's participation other than to an Affiliate or a Related Fund shall be in a minimum amount of £1,000,000 unless the
