# 9.3 Repayment of Revolving Facility Loans

(a) Subject to paragraph (c) below, each Borrower which has drawn a Revolving Facility Loan shall repay that Loan on the last day of its Interest Period.

(b) Without prejudice to each Borrower's obligation under paragraph (a) above, if:

- (i) one or more Revolving Facility Loans are to be made available to a Borrower:
- - (A) on the same day that a maturing Revolving Facility Loan is due to be repaid by that Borrower;
- (B) in the same currency as the maturing Revolving Facility Loan (unless it arose as a result of the operation of clause 7.2 (Unavailability of a Currency)); and
- (C) in whole or in part for the purpose of refinancing the maturing Revolving Facility Loan; and

(ii) the proportion borne by each Lender's participation in the maturing Revolving Facility Loan to the amount of that maturing Revolving Facility Loan is the same as the proportion borne by that Lender's participation in the new Revolving Facility Loans to the aggregate amount of those new Revolving Facility Loans,

the aggregate amount of the new Revolving Facility Loans shall, unless the relevant Borrower or the Parent notifies the Facility Agent to the contrary in the relevant Utilisation Request, be treated as if applied in or towards repayment of the maturing Revolving Facility Loan so that:

- (A) if the amount of the maturing Revolving Facility Loan exceeds the aggregate amount of the new Revolving Facility Loans:
- - (aa) the relevant Borrower will only be required to make a payment under clause 34.1 (Payments to the Facility Agent) in an amount in the relevant currency equal to that excess; and
- (bb) each Lender's participation in the new Revolving Facility Loans shall be treated as having been made available and applied by the Borrower in or towards repayment of that Lender's participation in the maturing Revolving Facility Loan and that Lender will not be required to make a payment under clause 34.1 (Payments to the Facility Agent) in respect of its participation in the new Revolving Facility Loans;

(B) if the amount of the maturing Revolving Facility Loan is equal to or less than the aggregate amount of the new Revolving Facility Loans:

(bb) each Lender will be required to make a payment under clause 34.1 (Payments to the Facility Agent) in respect of its participation in the new Revolving Facility Loans only to the extent that its participation in the new Revolving Facility Loans exceeds that Lender's participation in the maturing Revolving Facility Loan and the remainder of that Lender's participation in the new Revolving Facility Loans shall be treated as having been made available and applied by the Borrower in or towards repayment of that Lender's participation in the maturing Revolving Facility Loan.

(c) At any time when a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, the maturity date of each of the participations of that Lender in the Revolving Facility Loans then outstanding will be automatically extended to the last day of the Availability Period applicable to the Revolving Facility and will be treated as separate Revolving Facility Loans (the "Separate Loans") denominated in the currency in which the relevant participations are outstanding.

(d) If the Borrower makes a prepayment of a Revolving Facility Utilisation pursuant to clause 10.4 (Voluntary Prepayment of Revolving Facility Utilisations), a Borrower to whom a Separate Loan is outstanding may prepay that Loan by giving not less than 5 Business Days' prior notice to the Facility Agent. The proportion borne by the amount of the prepayment of the Separate Loan to the amount of the Separate Loans shall not exceed the proportion borne by the amount of the prepayment of the Revolving Facility Utilisation to the Revolving Facility Utilisations. The Facility Agent will forward a copy of a prepayment notice received in accordance with this paragraph (d) to the Defaulting Lender concerned as soon as practicable on receipt.

(e) Interest in respect of a Separate Loan will accrue for successive Interest Periods selected by the Borrower by the time and date specified by the Facility Agent (acting reasonably) and will be payable by that Borrower to the Facility Agent (for the account of that Defaulting Lender) on the last day of each Interest Period of that Loan.

(f) The terms of this agreement relating to Revolving Facility Loans generally shall continue to apply to Separate Loans other than to the extent inconsistent with paragraphs (c) to (e) (inclusive) above, in which case those paragraphs shall prevail in respect of any Separate Loan.
